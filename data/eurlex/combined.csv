Les parties contractantes, pour am\u00e9liorer la qualit\u00e9 des eaux du Rhin, prennent, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions suivantes, les mesures appropri\u00e9es pour:\na) \u00e9liminer la pollution des eaux de surface du bassin du Rhin par les substances dangereuses incluses dans les familles et groupes de substances figurant \u00e0 l''annexe I (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9nomm\u00e9es \u00absubstances relevant de l''annexe I\u00bb). Elles se proposent d''atteindre, progressivement, l''\u00e9limination des rejets de ces substances en tenant compte des r\u00e9sultats des examens effectu\u00e9s par les experts concernant chacune d''entre elles, ainsi que des moyens techniques disponibles;\nb) r\u00e9duire la pollution des eaux du Rhin par les substances dangereuses incluses dans les familles et groupes de substances figurant \u00e0 l''annexe II (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9nomm\u00e9es \u00absubstances relevant de l''annexe II\u00bb).\n2. Les mesures vis\u00e9es au paragrafe 1 ci-dessus sont prises en tenant compte, dans une mesure raisonnable, de ce que les eaux du Rhin sont utilis\u00e9es aux fin suivantes:\na) La production d''eau d''alimentation en vue de la consommation humaine;\nb) la consommation par les animaux domestiques et sauvages;\nc) la conservation et la mise en valeur des esp\u00e8ces naturelles pour ce qui est tant de la faune que de la flore et la conservation du pouvoir auto-\u00e9purateur des eaux;\nd) la p\u00eache;\ne) les fins r\u00e9cr\u00e9atives, compte tenu des exigences de l''hygi\u00e8ne et de l''esth\u00e9tique;\nf) les apports directs ou indirects d''eaux douces aux terres \u00e0 des fins agricoles;\ng) la production d''eau \u00e0 usage industriel;\net la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server une qualit\u00e9 acceptable des eaux de mer.\n3. Les dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente convention ne constituent qu''un premier pas pour atteindre l''objectif vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 1 ci-dessus.\n4. L''annexe A \u00e0 la convention pr\u00e9cise ce que les parties contractantes entendent par \u00abRhin\u00bb pour l''application de ladite convention.\nArticle 2\n1. Les gouvernements, parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente convention, font effectuer, pour leur usage, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du paragraphe 1 de l''annexe III, un inventaire national des rejets dans les eaux de surface du bassin du Rhin qui peuvent contenir des substances relevant de l''annexe I auxquelles des normes d''\u00e9mission sont applicables.\n2. Les gouvernements communiquent \u00e0 la Commission internationale pour la protection du Rhin contre la pollution (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e \u00abla Commission internationale\u00bb), conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du paragraphe 2 de l''annexe III, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de leur inventaire mis \u00e0 jour r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et au moins tous les trois ans.\n3. Les propositions de la Commission internationale pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 3 de l''article 6 peuvent comprendre, si n\u00e9cessaire, un inventaire de diverses substances relevant de l''annexe II.\nArticle 3\n1. Tout rejet effectu\u00e9 dans les eaux de surface du bassin du Rhin, susceptible de contenir l''une des substances relevant de l''annexe I, est soumis \u00e0 une autorisation pr\u00e9alable d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par l''autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente du gouvernement concern\u00e9.\n2. Pour les rejets de ces substances dans les eaux de surface du bassin du Rhin et, lorsque cela est n\u00e9cessaire aux fins de l''application de la pr\u00e9sente convention, pour les rejets de ces substances dans les \u00e9gouts, l''autorisation fixe des normes d''\u00e9mission qui ne peuvent d\u00e9passer les valeurs limites fix\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l''article 5.\n3. En ce qui concerne les rejets existants de ces substances, l''autorisation fixe un d\u00e9lai pour le respect des conditions qu''elle pr\u00e9voit. Ce d\u00e9lai ne peut exc\u00e9der les limites fix\u00e9es conform\u00e9ments au paragraphe 3 de l''article 5.\n4. L''autorisation ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e que pour une dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e. Elle peut \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9e compte tenu des \u00e9ventuelles modifications des valeurs limites vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l''article 5.\nArticle 4\n1. Les normes d''emission fix\u00e9es par les autorisations d\u00e9livr\u00e9es en application de l''article 3 d\u00e9terminent:\na) la concentration maximale admissible d''une substance dans les rejets. En cas de dilution, la valeur limite pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 2 sous a) de l''article 5 est \u00e0 diviser par le facteur de dilution;\nb) la quantit\u00e9 maximale admissible d''une substance dans les rejets pendant une ou plusieurs p\u00e9riodes d\u00e9termin\u00e9es. Si n\u00e9cessaire, cette quantit\u00e9 maximale peut, en outre, \u00eatre exprim\u00e9e en unit\u00e9 de poids du polluant par unit\u00e9 d''\u00e9l\u00e9ment caract\u00e9ristique de l''activit\u00e9 polluante (par exemple, unit\u00e9 de poids par mati\u00e8re premi\u00e8re ou par unit\u00e9 de produit).\n2. Si l''auteur du rejet d\u00e9clare qu''il n''est pas en mesure de respecter les normes d''\u00e9mission impos\u00e9es, ou si l''autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente du gouvernement concern\u00e9 constate cette impossibilit\u00e9, l''autorisation est refus\u00e9e.\n3. Si les normes d''\u00e9mission ne sont pas respect\u00e9es, l''autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente du gouvernement concern\u00e9 prend toutes les m\u00e9sures utiles pour faire en sorte que les conditions de l''autorisation soient remplies et, si n\u00e9cessaires, que le rejet soit interdit.\nArticle 5\n1. La Commission Internationale propose les valeurs limites pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 2 de l''article 3 et, si n\u00e9cessaire, leur application aux rejets dans les \u00e9gouts. Ces valeurs limites sont fix\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l''article 14. Apr\u00e8s leur adoption, elles sont incluses dans l''annexe IV.\n2. Ces valeurs limites sont d\u00e9finies:\na) par la concentration maximale admissible d''une substance dans les rejets\net, si cela est appropri\u00e9,\nb) par la quantit\u00e9 maximale admissible d''une telle substance, exprim\u00e9e en unit\u00e9 de poids du polluant par unit\u00e9 d''\u00e9l\u00e9ment caract\u00e9ristique de l''activit\u00e9 polluante (par exemple, unit\u00e9 de poids par mati\u00e8re premi\u00e8re ou par unit\u00e9 de produit).\nSi cela est appropri\u00e9, les valeurs lilites applicables aux effluents industriels sont fix\u00e9es par secteur et par type de produit.\nLes valeurs limites applicables aux substances relevant de l''annexe I sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9es principalement sur la base:\n- de la toxicit\u00e9,\n- de la persistance,\n- de la bioaccumulation,\nen tenant compte des meilleurs moyens techniques disponibles.\n3. La Commission internationale propose aux parties contractantes les limites des d\u00e9lais vis\u00e9es au paragraphe 3 de l''article 3 en fonction des caract\u00e9ristiques propres aux secteurs industriels concern\u00e9s et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, aux types de produit. Ces limites sont fix\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l''article 14.\n4. La Commission internationale utilise les r\u00e9sultats obtenus aux points de mesure internationaux pour \u00e9valuer dans quelle mesure la teneur des eaux du Rhin en substances relevant de l''annexe I varie apr\u00e8s application des dispositions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes.\n5. La Commission internationale peut, si n\u00e9cessaire, du point de vue de la qualit\u00e9 des eaux du Rhin, proposer d''autres mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9duire la pollution des eaux du Rhin, en tenant compte notamment de la toxicit\u00e9, de la persistance et de la bioaccumulation de la substance consid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Ces propositions sont adopt\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l''article 14.\nArticle 6\n1. Tout rejet de l''une des substances relevant de l''annexe II, susceptible d''affecter la qualit\u00e9 des eaux du Rhin, doit faire l''objet d''une r\u00e9glementation par les autorit\u00e9s nationales aux fins d''une limitation s\u00e9v\u00e8re.\n2. Les gouvernements, parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente convention, s''efforcent d''\u00e9tablir, dans un d\u00e9lai de deux ans \u00e0 compter de l''entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la pr\u00e9sente convention, des programmes nationaux de r\u00e9duction de la pollution des eaux du Rhin par les substances relevant de l''annexe II pour l''ex\u00e9cution desquels ils appliquent en particulier les moyens pr\u00e9vus aux paragraphes 1, 4, 5, 6 et 7 du pr\u00e9sent article.\n3. Les parties contractantes se concertent au sein de la Commission internationale pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l''\u00e9tablissement de ces programmes nationaux. Dans ce but, la Commission internationale proc\u00e8de r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 une comparaison des projets de programmes nationaux en vue d''assurer la coh\u00e9rence des objectifs et des moyens de ces projets et pr\u00e9sente des propositions en vue d''atteindre notamment des objectifs communs de r\u00e9duction de la pollution des eaux du Rhin. Ces derni\u00e8res propositions sont adopt\u00e9es en application de la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l''article 14 de la pr\u00e9sente convention. La comparaison des projets de programmes nationaux ne peut conduire \u00e0 retarder la mise en oeuvre au niveau national ou r\u00e9gional des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9duire la pollution des eaux du Rhin.\n4. Tout rejet susceptible de contenir l''une des substances relevant de l''annexe II est soumis \u00e0 une autorisation pr\u00e9alable d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par l''autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente du gouvernement concern\u00e9 et fixant les normes d''\u00e9mission. Celles-ci sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9es en fonction des objectifs de qualit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 5.\n5. Les programmes vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 2 ci-dessus comprennent des objectis de qualit\u00e9 pour les eaux du Rhin.\n6. Les programmes peuvent \u00e9galement contenir des dispositions sp\u00e9cifiques relatives \u00e0 la composition et \u00e0 l''emploi de substances ou groupes de substances ainsi que de produit, et tiennent compte des derniers progr\u00e8s techniques \u00e9conomiquement r\u00e9alisables.\n7. Les programmes fixent les d\u00e9lais de leur mise en oeuvre.\n8. Les programmes et les r\u00e9sultats de leur application sont communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission internationale sous forme r\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\nArticle 7\n1. Les parties contractantes prennent toutes les mesures l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires garantissant que la mise en d\u00e9p\u00f4t des substances relevant des annexes I et II soit effectu\u00e9e de telle mani\u00e8re qu''il n''y ait pas de menace de pollution pour les eaux du Rhin.\n2. La Commission internationale propose, si n\u00e9cessaire, aux parties contractantes des mesures appropri\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 la protection des eaux souterraines en vue de pr\u00e9venir la pollution des eaux du Rhin par les substances relevant des annexes I et II.\nArticle 8\n1. Les parties contractantes veillent \u00e0 ce que les rejets soient contr\u00f4l\u00e9s en application de la pr\u00e9sente convention.\n2. Elles informent annuellement la Commission internationale des exp\u00e9riences acquises.\nArticle 9\nL''application des mesures prises en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente convention ne peut en aucun cas avoir pour effet de permettre d''accro\u00eetre directement ou indirectement la pollution des eaux du Rhin.\nArticle 10\n1. En vue de contr\u00f4ler la teneur des eaux du Rhin en substances relevant des annexes I et II, chaque gouvernement concern\u00e9 prend \u00e0 sa charge aux stations de mesure convenues sur le Rhin l''installation et le fonctionnement d''appareils et de syst\u00e8mes de mesure, servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la concentration desdites substances.\n2. Chaque gouvernement concern\u00e9 informe r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, au moins une fois par an, la Commission internationale des r\u00e9sultats de ces contr\u00f4les.\n3. La Commission internationale r\u00e9dige un rapport annuel r\u00e9sumant les r\u00e9sultats des contr\u00f4les et permettant de suivre l''\u00e9volution de la qualit\u00e9 des eaux du Rhin.\nArticle 11\nLorsqu''un gouvernement, partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente convention, constate dans les eaux du Rhin un accroissement soudain et notable des substances relevant des annexes I et II ou a connaissance d''un accident dont les cons\u00e9quences sont susceptibles de menacer gravement la qualit\u00e9 de ces eaux, il en informe sans retard la Commission internationale et les parties contractantes susceptibles d''en \u00eatre affect\u00e9es selon une proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 \u00e9laborer par la Commission internationale.\nArticle 12\n1. Les parties contractantes informent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement la Commission internationale de leurs exp\u00e9riences acquises lors de l''application de la pr\u00e9sente convention.\n2. La Commission internationale formule, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, des recommandations, afin d''am\u00e9liorer progressivement l''application de cette convention.\nArticle 13\nLa Commission internationale \u00e9labore des recommandations en vue d''atteindre des r\u00e9sultats comparables par l''emploi de m\u00e9thodes appropri\u00e9es de mesures et d''analyses.\nArticle 14\n1. Les annexes I \u00e0 IV qui font partie int\u00e9grante de la pr\u00e9sente convention peuvent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es et compl\u00e9t\u00e9es en vue de les adapter au d\u00e9veloppement scientifique et technique ou d''am\u00e9liorer l''efficacit\u00e9 de la lutte contre la pollution chimique des eaux du Rhin.\n2. \u00c0 cette fin, la Commission internationale recommande les modifications ou compl\u00e9ments qui lui paraissent utiles.\n3. Les textes modifi\u00e9s ou compl\u00e9t\u00e9s entreront en vigueur apr\u00e8s adoption unanime par les parties contractantes.\nArticle 15\nTout diff\u00e9rend entre des parties contractantes relatif \u00e0 l''interpr\u00e9tation ou \u00e0 l''application de la pr\u00e9sente convention et qui n''aura pu \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par voie de n\u00e9gociation est, sauf si les parties au diff\u00e9rend en disposent autrement, soumis, \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l''une d''entre elles, \u00e0 l''arbitrage conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l''annexe B qui fait partie int\u00e9grante de la pr\u00e9sente convention.\nArticle 16\nPour l''application de la pr\u00e9sente convention, la Communaut\u00e9 \u00e9conomique europ\u00e9enne et ses \u00c9tats membres agissent dans les domaines relevant de leurs comp\u00e9tences respectives.\nArticle 17\n1. Chaque partie signataire notifiera au gouvernement de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration suisse l''ex\u00e9cution des proc\u00e9dures requises en ce qui la concerne pour l''entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la pr\u00e9sente convention.\n2. Sous r\u00e9serve de la notification par chaque partie de l''accomplissement des proc\u00e9dures requises pour l''entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l''accord additionnel \u00e0 l''accord concernant la Commission internationale pour la protection du Rhin contre la pollution, la pr\u00e9sente Convention entrera en vigueur le premier jour du deuxi\u00e8me mois suivant la r\u00e9ception de la derni\u00e8re notification pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nArticle 18\n\u00c0 l''expiration d''un d\u00e9lai de trois ans apr\u00e8s son entr\u00e9e en vigueur, la pr\u00e9sente convention pourra \u00eatre d\u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 tout moment par chacune des parties contractantes par une d\u00e9claration adress\u00e9e au gouvernement de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration suisse. La d\u00e9nonciation prendra effet, pour la partie qui d\u00e9nonce, six mois apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception de la d\u00e9claration par le gouvernement de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration suisse.\nArticle 19\nLe gouvernement de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration suisse informera les parties contractantes de la date de r\u00e9ception de toute notification ou d\u00e9claration re\u00e7ue en application des articles 14, 17 et 18.\nArticle 20\n1. Si l''accord du 29 avril 1963 concernant la Commission internationale pour la protection du Rhin contre la pollution est d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par l''une des parties audit accord, les parties contractantes proc\u00e9deront sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 des consultations au sujet des dispositions n\u00e9cessaires en vue d''assurer la continuit\u00e9 de l''ex\u00e9cution des t\u00e2ches qui, aux termes de la pr\u00e9sente convention, incombent \u00e0 la Commission internationale.\n2.

Le tribunal arbitral est compos\u00e9 de trois membres. Chacune des parties au diff\u00e9rend nomme un arbitre. Les deux arbitres ainsi nomm\u00e9s d\u00e9signent d''un commun accord le troisi\u00e8me arbitre qui assume la pr\u00e9sidence du tribunal.\nSi, au terme d''un d\u00e9lai de deux mois \u00e0 compter de la d\u00e9signation du deuxi\u00e8me arbitre, le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal n''a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sident de la Cour europ\u00e9enne des droits de l''homme proc\u00e8de, \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la partie la plus diligente, dans un nouveau d\u00e9lai de deux mois, \u00e0 sa d\u00e9signation.\n3. Si, dans un d\u00e9lai de deux mois apr\u00e8s la reception de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l''article 15 de la convention, l''une des parties au diff\u00e9rend n''a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9signation qui lui incombe d''un membre du tribunal, l''autre partie peut saisir le pr\u00e9sident de la Cour europ\u00e9enne des droits de l''homme qui d\u00e9signe le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal arbitral dans un nouveau d\u00e9lai de deux mois. D\u00e8s sa d\u00e9signation le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal demande \u00e0 la partie qui n''a pas nomm\u00e9 d''arbitre de le faire dans un d\u00e9lai de deux mois. Pass\u00e9 ce d\u00e9lai, il saisit le pr\u00e9sident de la Cour europ\u00e9enne des droits de l''homme qui proc\u00e8de \u00e0 cette nomination dans un nouveau d\u00e9lai de deux mois.\n4. Si, dans les cas vis\u00e9s aux paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le pr\u00e9sident de la Cour europ\u00e9enne des droits de l''homme se trouve emp\u00each\u00e9 ou s''il est le ressortissant de l''une des parties au diff\u00e9rend, la d\u00e9signation du pr\u00e9sident du tribunal arbitral ou la nomination de l''arbitre incombe au vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Cour ou au membre le plus ancien de la Cour qui ne se trouve pas emp\u00each\u00e9 et qui n''est pas le ressortissant de l''une des parties au diff\u00e9rend.\n5. Les dispositions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent s''appliquent, selon le cas, pour pouvoir aux si\u00e8ges devenus vacants.\n6. Le tribunal arbitral d\u00e9cide, selon les r\u00e8gles du droit international et, en particulier, selon les dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente convention.\n7. Les d\u00e9cisions du tribunal arbitral, tant sur la proc\u00e9dure que sur le fond, sont prises \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des voix des ses membres, l''absence ou l''abstention d''un des membres du tribunal d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par les parties n''emp\u00eachant pas le tribunal de statuer. En cas de partage \u00e9gal des voix, la voix du pr\u00e9sident lient les parties. Celles-ci supportent les frais de l''arbitre qu''elles ont d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et se partagent \u00e0 part \u00e9gale les autres frais. Sur les autres points, le tribunal arbitral r\u00e8gle lui-m\u00eame sa proc\u00e9dure.\n8. En cas de diff\u00e9rend entre deux parties contractantes dont une seule est un \u00c9tat membre de la Communaut\u00e9 \u00e9conomique europ\u00e9enne, elle-m\u00eame partie contractante, l''autre partie adresse la requ\u00eate, \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 cet \u00c9tat membre et \u00e0 la Communaut\u00e9, qui lui notifient conjointement, dans un d\u00e9lai de deux mois apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception de la requ\u00eate, si l''\u00c9tat membre, la Communaut\u00e9 ou l''\u00c9tat membre et la Communaut\u00e9 conjointement se constituent partie au diff\u00e9rend. \u00c0 defaut d''une telle notification dans ledit d\u00e9lai, l''\u00c9tat membre et la Communaut\u00e9 sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s n''\u00eatre qu''une seule et m\u00eame partie au diff\u00e9rend pour l''application des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente annexe.

Ten einde de kwaliteit van het water van de Rijn te verbeteren, nemen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, overeenkomstig de hierna volgende bepalingen, alle passende maatregelen om:\na) de verontreiniging van de oppervlaktewateren van het stroomgebied van de Rijn door de gevaarlijke stoffen die zijn begrepen onder de families en groepen van stoffen die worden genoemd in bijlage I (hierna te noemen de \"onder bijlage I vallende stoffen\") te be\u00ebindigen. Zij willen geleidelijk komen tot be\u00ebindiging van de lozingen van die stoffen, daarbij rekening houdend met de resultaten van de onderzoekingen die door deskundigen zijn verricht voor elk van die stoffen, alsook met de beschikbare technische middelen;\nb) de verontreiniging van het water van de Rijn door de gevaarlijke stoffen die zijn begrepen onder de families en groepen van stoffen die worden genoemd in bijlage II (hierna te noemen de \"onder bijlage I vallende stoffen\") te verminderen.\n2. Bij het nemen van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen wordt er in redelijke mate rekening mee gehouden dat het water van de Rijn wordt gebruikt voor de volgende doeleinden:\na) de bereiding van drinkwater voor menselijke consumptie,\nb) consumptie door huisdieren en in het wild levende dieren,\nc) het behoud en het onderhouden van de natuurlijke flora en fauna, alsmede het behoud van het zelfreinigend vermogen van het water,\nd) visvangst,\ne) recreatie, rekening houdend met de hygi\u00ebnische en esthetische vereisten,\nf) de directe of indirecte toevoer van zoet water naar het land voor agrarische doeleinden,\ng) de produktie van water voor industriel gebruik,\nen de noodzaak tot het behoud van een aanvaardbare kwaliteit van het zeewater.\n3. Het bepaalde in deze Overeenkomst vormt slechts een eerste stap naar verwezenlijking van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel vervatte doelstelling.\n4. Bijlage A van de Overeenkomst geeft een omschrijving van wat de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen bij de toepassing daarvan onder \"Rijn\" verstaan.\nArtikel 2\n1. De Regeringen die partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst laten, overeenkomstig het bepaalde in bijlage III, paragraaf 1, voor eigen gebruik een nationale lijst opstellen van de lozingen in de oppervlaktewateren van het stroomgebied van de Rijn, die stoffen kunnen bevatten, welke vallen onder bijlage I en waarop emissienormen van toepassing zijn.\n2. De Regeringen delen aan de Internationale Commissie ter bescherming van de Rijn tegen verontreiniging (hierna te noemen \"de Internationale Commissie\") overeenkomstig het bepaalde in bijlage III, paragraaf 2, de gegevens mede van deze regelmatig en ten minste eenmaal per drie jaar bijgewerkte lijst.\n3. De voorstellen van de Internationale Commissie bedoeld in artikel 6, derde lid, kunne zo nodig de opstelling omvatten van een lijst van verschillende onder bijlage II vallende stoffen.\nArtikel 3\n1. Voor elke lozing in de oppervlaktewateren van het stroomgebied van de Rijn, die een van de onder bijlage I vallende stoffen kan bevatten, is vooraf een vergunning nodig, die wordt verleend door de bevoegde autoriteit van de desbetreffende Regering.\n2. Voor lozingen van deze stoffen in de opervlaktewateren van het stroomgebied van de Rijn en, wanneer zulks voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst noodzakelijk is, voor lozingen van deze stoffen in riolen, worden in de vergunning emissienormen vastgesteld, die de overeenkomstig artikel 5 vastgestelde grenswaarden niet mogen overschrijden.\n3. Wat betreft de bestaande lozingen van deze stoffen, wordt in de vergunning een termijn bepaald voor de naleving van de hierin gestelde voorwaarden. Deze termijn mag de overeenkomstig artikel 5, derde lid, vastgestelde grenzen niet overschrijden.\n4. De vergunning mag slechts worden verleend voor een beperkte duur. Zij kan worden vernieuwd met inachtneming van de eventuele wijzigingen van de grenswaarden bedoeld in artikel 5.\nArtikel 4\n1. In de emissienormen, vastgesteld in de vergunningen verleend uit hoofde van artikel 3, worden bepaald:\na) de in de lozingen toelaatbare maximumconcentratie van een stof. In geval van verdunning moet de in artikel 5, tweede lid, sub a), bedoelde grenswaarde worden gedeeld door de verdunningsfactor;\nb) de in de lozingen toelaatbare maximumhoeveelheid van een stof tijdens \u00e9\u00e9n of meer vastgestelde perioden. Zo nodig kan deze hoeveelheid bovendien worden uitgedrukt in een gewichtseenheid van de verontreinigende stof per eenheid van het element dat kenmerkend is voor de verontreinigende werking (bijvoorbeeld per gewichtseenheid grondstof of per eenheid produkt).\n2. Indien de lozer verklaart dat hij de opgelegde emissienormen niet in acht kan nemen, of indien de bevoegde autoriteit van de betrokken Regering zulks constateert, wordt de vergunning geweigerd.\n3. Indien de emissienormen niet in acht worden genomen, neemt de bevoegde autoriteit van de betrokken Regering alle nodige maatregelen om ervoor te zorgen dat aan de voorwaarden van de vergunning wordt voldaan en dat, zo nodig, de lozing wordt verboden.\nArtikel 5\n1. De Internationale Commissie stelt de grenswaarden, bedoeld in artikel 3, tweede lid, voor en zo nodig de toepassing hiervan op lozingen in riolen. Deze grenswaarden worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de in artikel 14 bepaalde procedure. Na aanneming worden zij opgenomen in bijlage IV.\n2. Deze grenswaarden worden bepaald:\na) door de in de lozingen toelaatbare maximumconcentratie van een stof, en\nb) indien dit past, door de toelaatbare maximumhoeveelheid van zulk een stof, uitgedrukt in een gewichtseenheid van de verontreinigende stof per eenheid van het element dat kenmerkend is voor de verontreinigende werking (bijvoorbeeld per gewichtseenheid grondstof of per eenheid produkt).\nIndien dit past, worden de grenswaarden die op industrieel afvalwater van toepassing zijn, per sector en per type produkt vastgesteld.\nDe grenszaarden welke van toepassing zijn op de onder bijlage I vallende stoffen worden voornamelijk vastgesteld op basis van:\n- de toxiciteit,\n- de persistentie,\n- de bioaccumulatie,\nmet inachtneming van de beste beschikbare technische middelen.\n3. De Internationale Commissie stelt aan de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de in artikel 3, derde lid, bedoelde termijngrenzen voor, met inachtneming van de eigen kenmerken van de betrokken industri\u00eble sectoren en, in voorkomend geval, van de typen produkten. Deze grenzen worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de in artikel 14 bepaalde procedure.\n4.De Internationale Commissie gebruikt de resultaten die zijn verkregen op de internationale meetpunten om vast te stellen in welke mate het gehalte van de onder bijlage I vallende stoffen in het water van de Rijn verandert na toepassing van de voorgaande bepalingen.\n5. De Internationale Commissie kan, zo nodig, vanuit het oogpunt van de kwaliteit van het water van de Rijn, andere maatregelen voorstellen, die zijn bestemd om de verontreiniging van het water van de Rijn te verminderen, rekening houdend met name met de toxiciteit, de persistentie in de bioaccumulatie van de betrokken stof. Deze voorstellen worden aangenomen overeenkomstig de in artikel 14 bepaalde procedure.\nArtikel 6\n1. Elke lozing van \u00e9\u00e9n van de onder bijlage II vallende stoffen, die van nadelige invloed kan zijn op de kwaliteit van het water van de Rijn, dient door de nationale autoriteiten te worden gereglementeerd, ten einde deze aanzienlijk te beperken.\n2. De Regeringen die partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst streven ernaar, binnen een termijn van twee jaar, te rekenen vanaf de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst, nationale programma''s op te stellen tot beperking van de verontreiniging van het water van de Rijn door de onder bijlage II vallende stoffen; voor de uitvoering hiervan passen zijn in het bijzonder de in het eerste, vierde, zesde en zevende lid van dit artikel aangegeven middelen toe.\n3. Alvorens deze nationale programma''s vast te stellen, plegen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen binnen de Internationale Commissie onderling overleg ten einde deze programma''s op elkaar af te stemmen. Hiertoe gaat de Internationale Commissie regelmatig over tot vergelijking van de ontwerpen van nationale programma''s, ten einde te verzekeren dat er samenhang bestaat tussen de doelstellingen en de middelen van deze ontwerpen, en doet zij voorstellen ten einde met name gemeenschappelijke doelstellingen te verwezenlijken inzake vermindering van de verontreiniging van het water van de Rijn. Deze laatste voorstellen worden aangenomen volgens de in artikel 14 van deze Overeenkomst bepaalde procedure. De vergelijking van nationale ontwerp-programma''s mag niet leiden tot vertraging in de tenuitvoerlegging op nationaal of regionaal niveau van maatregelen die zijn bestemd om de verontreiniging van het water van de Rijn te verminderen.\n4. Voor iedere lozing die een van de onder bijlage II vallende stoffen kan bevatten, is een voorafgaande vergunning nodig, die door de bevoegde autoriteit van de betrokken Regering wordt verleend en waarin de emissienormen worden vastgesteld. Deze worden bepaald aan de hand van de in het vijfde lid aangegeven kwaliteitsdoelstellingen.\n5. De in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde programma''s bevatten kwaliteitsdoelstellingen voor het water van de Rijn.\n6. De programma''s kunnen eveneens specifieke voorschriften bevatten, die op de samenstelling en het gebruik van stoffen of groepen van stoffen, alsmede produkten betrekking hebben; in de programma''s wordt rekening gehouden met de jongste technische ontwikkelingen die economisch te verwezenlijken zijn.\n7. In de programma''s worden de termijnen vastgesteld voor de tenuitvoerlegging hiervan.\n8. De programma''s en de resultaten van de toepassing hiervan worden in beknopte vorm aan de Internationale Commissie medegedeeld.\nArtikel 7\n1. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nemen alle wetgevende en administratieve maatregelen om te garanderen dat de opslag van de onder de bijlagen I en II vallende stoffen op zodanige wijze geschiedt, dat dit geen bedreiging inhoudt van verontreiniging van het water van de Rijn.\n2. De Internationale Commissie stelt zo nodig aan de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen passende maatregelen voor met betrekking tot de bescherming van het grondwater, ten einde te voorkimen dat het water van de Rijn wordt verontreinigd door de onder de bijlagen I en II valende stoffen.\nArtikel 8\n1. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zien erop toe dat er krachtens deze Overeenkomst controle wordt uitgeoefend op de lozingen.\n2. Zij delen eenmaal per jaar de door hen opgedane ervaringen aan de Internationale Commissie made.\nArtikel 9\nToepassing van de krachtens deze Overeenkomst genomen maatregelen mag in geen geval direct of indirect toeneming van de verontreiniging van het water van de Rijn tot gevolg hebben.\nArtikel 10\n1. Ten einde controle uit te oefenen op het gehalte van onder de bijlagen I en II vallende stoffen in het water van de Rijn, neemt iedere betrokken Regering op de overeengekomen meetstations aan de Rijn, de installatie en het in bedrijf houden voor zijn rekening van meetapparaten en -systemen, die dienen om de concentratie van genoemde stoffen te bepalen.\n2. Iedere betrokken Regering brengt regelmatig en ten minste eenmaal per jaar, de resultaten van deze controles ter kennis van de Internationale Commissie.\n3. De Internationale Commissie stelt jaarlijks een verslag op, waarin de resultaten van deze controles worden samengevat en door middel waarvan de ontwikkeling van de kwaliteit van het water van de Rijn kan worden gevolgd.\nArtikel 11\nWanneer een Regering die partij is bij deze Overeenkomst een plotselinge en aanzienlijke toeneming van onder de bijlagen I en II vallende stoffen in het water van de Rijn vaststelt, of wanneer zij kennis draagt van een ongeval, waarvan de gevolgen de kwaliteit van dit water ernstig kunnen bedreigen, stelt zij hiervan de Internationale Commissie en de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die hierdoor kunnen worden getroffen, onverwijld in kennis, volgens een door de Internationale Commissie vast te stellen procedure.\nArtikel 12\n1. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen stellen regelmatig de Internationale Commissie op de hoogte van de ervaringen die zij hebben opgedaan bij de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst.\n2. In voorkomend geval stelt de Internationale Commissie aanbevelingen op voor een geleidelijke verbetering van de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst.\nArtikel 13\nDe Internationale Commissie stelt aanbevelingen op om te komen tot vergelijkbare resultaten door het gebruik van passende methoden voor het verrichten van metingen en analyses.\nArtikel 14\n1. De bijlagen I tot en met IV, die een integrerend deel virmen van deze Overeenkomst, kunnen worden gewijzigd en aangevuld ten einde deze aan te passen aan de wetenschappelijke en technische ontwikkeling of de doeltreffendheid te verbeteren van de bestrijding van de chemische verontreiniging van het water van de Rijn.\n2. Tot dit doel beveelt de Internationale Commissie die wijzigingen of aanvullingen aan, die haar nuttig lijken.\n3. De gewijzigde of aangevulde teksten treden in werking nadat zij met eenparigheid van stemmen zijn aangenomen door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.\nArtikel 15\nIeder geschil tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst dat niet door onderhandeling kan worden beslecht, wordt, tenzij de partijen bij het geschil anders beslissen, op verzoek van \u00e9\u00e9n van hen, voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht overeenkomstig de bepalingen van bijlage B bij deze Overeenkomst, die hiervan een integrerend deel vormt.\nArtikel 16\nVoor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst treden de Europese Economische Gemeenschap en haar Lid-Staten op ter zake van de gebieden die vallen onder hun onderscheiden bevoegdheden.\nArtikel 17\n1. Elke ondertekenende Partij ieelt de Regering van de Zwitserse Bondsstaat mede wanneer aan de voor naar vereiste procedures voor de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst is voldaan.\n2. Onder voorbehoud van de kennisgeving door elke Partij dat is voldaan aan de procedures, vereist voor de inwerkingtreding van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst bij de Overeenkomst nopens de Internationale Commissie ter bescherming van de Rijn tegen verontreiniging, treedt deze Overeenkomst in werking op de eerste dag van de tweede maand die volgt op de ontvangst van de laatste mededeling voorzien in het vorige lid.\nArtikel 18\nNa het verstrijken van een tijdvak van drie jaar na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst, kan zij te allen tijde door elk van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen worden opgezegd, door middel van een mededeling aan de Regering van de Zwitserse Bondsstaat. De opzegging wordt voor de opzeggende Partij van kracht zes maanden na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Regering van de Zwitserse Bondsstaat.\nArtikel 19\nDe Regering van de Zwitserse Bondsstaat stelt de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in kennis van de datum van ontvangst van elke mededeling die is ontvangen krachtens de artikelen 14, 17 en 18.\nArtikel 20\n1. Indien de Overeenkomst van 29 april 1963 nopens de Internationale Commissie ter bescherming van de Rijn tegen verontreiniging wordt opgezegd door \u00e9\u00e9n van de Partijen bij die Overeenkomst, treden de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen onverwijld in overleg betreffende de maatregelen die nodig zijn om de continu\u00efteit te verzekeren bij de uitvoering van de taken die ingevolge deze Overeenkomst rusten op de Internationale Commissie.\n2. Indien binnen zes maanden na het begin van dit overleg geen overeenstemming is bereikt, kan elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen te allen tijde deze Overeenkomst opzeggen, overeenkomstig artikel 18, zonder te wachten tot er een tijdvak van drie jaar is verstreken.\nArtikel 21\nDeze Overeenkomst, die is opgesteld in \u00e9\u00e9n exemplaar, in de Duitse, de Franse en de Nederlandse taal, zijnde de drie teksten gelijkelijk authentiek, zal worden nedergelegd in het archief van de Zwitserse Bondsstaat, die daarvan een voor eensluidend gewaarmerkt afschrift zal doen toekomen aan elk van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.\nGedaan te Bonn op 3 december 1976\nVoor de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland:\nVoor de Regering van de Franse Republiek:\nVoor de Regering van het Groothertogdom Luxemburg:\nVoor de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden:\nVoor de Regering van de Zwitserse Bondsstaat:\nVoor de Europese Economische Gemeenschap:\nBIJLAGE A\nVoor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst begint de Rijn bij de uitstroming uit het Bodenmeer en omvat de rivierarmen door welke hij vrijelijk in de Noordzee uitstroomt tot aan de kustlijn, met inbegrip van de IJssel tot aan Kampen.\nBij het opstellen van de in artikel 6 van de Overeenkomst bedoelde nationale programma''s - voor zover het betreft de kwaliteitsdoelstellingen - alsook bij de co\u00f6rdinatie van deze programma''s binnen de Internationale Commissie, zal van geval tot geval rekening worden gehouden met het onderscheid tussen het zoetwater- en het brakwatergedeelte van de rivier.\nBIJLAGE B\nSCHEIDSRECHTSPRAAK\n1. Tenzij de partijen bij het geschil anders besluiten, wordt de scheidsrechterlijke procedure gevoerd met inachtneming van de bepalingen van deze bijlage.\n2. Het scheidsgerecht bestaat uit drie leden: ieder der partijen bij het geschil wijst een scheidsman aan; de beide aldus aangewezen scheidsmannen wijzen in onderlinge overeenstemming de derde scheidsman aan, die het voorzitterschap van het gerecht op zich neemt.\nIndien binnen twee maanden na de aanwijzing van de tweede scheidsman de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht niet is aangewezen, gaat de President van het Europese Hof voor de Rechten van de Mens, op verzoek van de meest gerede partij binnen een volgende periode van twee maanden, over tot de benoeming.\n3. Indien binnen twee maanden na de ontvangst van het verzoek bedoeld in artikel 15 van de Overeenkomst, \u00e9\u00e9n van de partijen bij het geschil niet is overgegaan tot de door haar te verrichten benoeming van een lid van het gerecht, kan de andere partij zich wenden tot de President van het Europese Hof voor de Rechten van de Mens, die de Voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht aanwijst binnen een volgende termijn van twee maanden. Zodra de Voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht is aangewezen, verzoek hij de partij die geen scheidsman heeft benoemd dit te doen binnen een termijn van twee maanden. Na het verstrijken van deze termijn, wendt hij zich tot de President van het Europese Hof voor de Rechten van de Mens, die binnen een volgende termijn van twee maanden overgaat tot de benoeming.\n4. Indien in de in de voorgaande leden bedoelde gevallen de President van het Europese Hof voor de Rechten van de Mens verhinderd mocht zijn of indien hij onderdaan is van \u00e9\u00e9n van de partijen bij het geschil, dient de aanwijzing van de Voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht of de benoeming van de scheidsman te geschieden door de Vice-President van het Hof of door het in dienstjaren oudste lid van het Hof dat niet verhinderd is en dat geen onderdaan is van \u00e9\u00e9n van de partijen bij het geschil.\n5. De voorgaande bepalingen zijn van overeenkomstige toepassing om in vacatures te voorzien.\n6. Het scheiddsgerecht beslist overeenkomstig de regels van het internationale recht en, in het bijzonder, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.\n7. Het scheidsgerecht beslist, zowel ten aanzien van de procedure als van de zaak zelf, met meerderheid van stemmen van zijn leden; wanneer \u00e9\u00e9n van de door partijen aangewezen leden van het gerecht niet aanwezig is of zich van stemming onthoudt, verhindert dit het gerecht niet uitspraak te doen.

The Contracting Parties shall, in accordance with the following provisions, take the appropriate measures, with a view to improving the quality of the waters of the Rhine, to: \n(a) eliminate pollution of the surface waters of the Rhine basin by dangerous substances in the families and groups of substances appearing in Annex I (hereinafter referred to as'' Annex I substances''). The purpose of the measures is to effect the gradual elimination of discharges of these substances, taking into account the findings of investigations carried out by experts separately for each one of them and the available technical means ; \n(b) reduce the pollution of the Rhine by the dangerous substances in the families and groups of substances appearing in Annex II (hereinafter referred to as'' Annex II substances''). \n2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 above shall take into reasonable account the fact that Rhine water is used for: \n(a) the production of drinking water for human consumption ; \n(b) consumption by domestic and wild animals ; \n(c) the conservation and development of the national species of flora and fauna and the preservation of the self-purifying capacity of water ; \n(d) fishing ; \n(e) recreational purposes, bearing in mind hygienic and aesthetic requirements ; \n(f) the direct or indirect supply of fresh water to agricultural lands ; \n(g) the production of water for industrial purposes, and the need to preserve an acceptable quality of sea water. \n3. The provisions of this Convention shall constitute only an initial step towards the achievement of the objectives set out in paragraph 1. \n4. Annex A to this Convention shall determine what the Contracting Parties mean by the word'' Rhine'' for the purposes of applying the said Convention. \nArticle 2 \n1. The Governments which are Parties to this Convention shall, pursuant to Annex III (1), establish for their own use a national inventory of discharges into the surface waters of the Rhine basin which may contain substances listed in Annex I, which are subject to emission standards. \n2. Pursuant to Annex III (2), the Governments shall communicate to the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine against Pollution (hereinafter referred to as the'' International Commission'') the contents of their inventories, which shall be regularly updated at intervals not exceeding three years.\n3. The proposals of the International Commission provided for in Article 6 (3) may, if necessary, include an inventory of various substances falling under Annex II. \nArticle 3 \n1. Any discharge into the surface waters of the Rhine basin likely to contain a substance referred to in Annex I shall be subject to prior authorization from the responsible authorities of the Government concerned. \n2. For discharges of these substances into the surface waters of the Rhine basin and, when necessary for the purpose of applying this Convention, for discharges of these substances into sewers, the authorization shall fix emission standards which may not exceed the limit values laid down in accordance with Article 5. \n3. In the case of existing discharges of these substances, the authorization shall fix a time limit within which the conditions laid down in the authorization must be met. This time limit must not exceed the period laid down in accordance with Article 5(3). \n4. The authorization may only be granted for a limited period of time. It may be renewed in the light of any alterations in the limit values referred to in Article 5. \nArticle 4 \n1. The emission standards laid down in the authorizations issued pursuant to Article 3 shall establish: \n(a) the maximum permissible concentration of a substance in discharges. In cases where there is dilution, the limit value provided for in Article 5 (2) (a) shall be divided by the dilution factor ; \n(b) the maximum permissible quantity of a substance in discharges during one or more specific periods. If necessary this quantity may also be expressed as a unit of weight of the pollutant per unit of the characteristic element of the polluting activity (e.g. unit of weight per unit of raw material or product unit). \n2. If the discharger states that he is unable to conform to the emission standards or if the responsible authorities of the Government concerned establish this, authorization shall be refused. \n3. If the emission standards are not observed, the responsible authorities of the Government concerned shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the conditions for the authorization are met and, if necessary, that the discharge is prohibited. \nArticle 5 \n1. The International Commission shall propose the limit values provided for in Article 3 (2) and if necessary their application to discharges into sewers. These limit values shall be laid down in conformity with the procedure provided for in Article 14. Upon adoption, they shall be included in Annex IV. \n2. These limit values are fixed in terms of: \n(a) the maximum permissible concentration of a substance in discharges and, \n(b) where appropriate, the maximum permissible quantity of such a substance expressed as a unit of weight of the pollutant per unit of the characteristic element of the polluting activity (e.g. unit of weight per unit of raw material or product unit). \nWhere appropriate, the limit values applicable to industrial effluent shall be laid down individually by sector and by type of product. \nThe limit values applicable to Annex I substances shall be laid down mainly on the basis of: \n- toxicity, \n- persistence, \n- bioaccumulation, taking into account the best available technical means. \n3. The International Commission shall propose to the Contracting Parties the time limits referred to in Article 3 (3), making due allowance for the specific characteristics of the industrial sectors involved and, as appropriate, the types of product. These time limits shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14. \n4. The International Commission shall use the results obtained at international measuring points to determine the extent to which the level of Annex I substances in the Rhine varies following the application of the above provisions. \n5. As regards the quality of Rhine water, the International Commission may if necessary propose other measures for reducing the pollution of the Rhine taking into account, inter alia, the toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation of the substance under consideration. These proposals shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14. \nArticle 6 \n1. The discharge of any Annex II substance likely to affect the quality of Rhine water must be regulated by the national authorities with a view to limiting it strictly. \n2.

(1964), 140 la (e) and 1402 (g)) as the basis for determining dutiable value in the case of certain chemicals, provided for in Schedule XX (United States), Part I, annexed to the Protocol (hereinafter referred to as Schedule XX), Section 4, Chapter 1. This is accomplished by the deletion of Notes 4 and 5 from Chapter 1, which provide for use of the American Selling Price system for such articles.\nIn addition, a new Note 4 is inserted providing for use of normal methods of valuation therefor (Section 402 (a) through (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. (1964) 140 la (a) through (d)).\n(b) Amendments\nUpon the entry into force of this Agreement, Schedule XX, Section 4, Chapter 1, shall be amended by striking out Notes 4 and 5 thereto, and by inserting in lieu thereof:\n\"4. The ad valorem rates provided for in this Chapter shall be based upon the methods of valuation provided for in Section 402(a) through (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. (1964) 140 la (a) through (d)).\"\nArticle 3\nSubstitution of Converted Concessions\n(a) Explanation\nThis Article removes from Schedule XX the original concessions on chemicals provided for in Units B and C. of Chapter 1 of Section 4, which are based on the American Selling Price system and replaces them with the substitute converted concessions, set forth in Appendix A, with concession rates based on normal methods of valuation. In addition, this Article removes Note 6 from Chapter 1, Unit C, which provides that specific duties on certain dyes shall be based on standards of strength, since the substitute converted concessions on these dyes involve only ad valorem rates of duty.\n(b) Amendments\nUpon the entry into force of this Agreement, Schedule XX, Section 4, Chapter 1, shall be amended by striking out Units B and C (original concessions), and by inserting in lieu thereof Units B and C in Appendix A to this Agreement (substitute converted concessions) which omit Note 6 of Unit C.\nArticle 4\nFurther Tariff Reductions\n(a) Explanation Article provides for the following tariff concessions by the United States on certain chemicals and other articles, not covered by Article 3, in return for the concessions provided for herein by the other parties to this Agreement:\n(i) paragraph (b)(i) of this Article repeals General Note 3(f) of Schedule XX, which provides that, in the absence of the additional concessions by the other parties to this Agreement, the United States will interrupt the staging of concessions on certain chemicals and other articles so that such concessions do not exceed two-fifths of each reduction to the full concession rate. With respect to such articles, as they are identified by item numbers in Appendix B to this Agreement, the United States is prepared to make the remaining three-fifths of such reduction in return for the additional concessions from the other parties, and\n(ii) paragraph (b)(ii) of this Article amends Schedule XX by deleting original concessions on certain additional chemicals and other articles and substituting therefor concessions which provide for full concession rates, constituting reductions in excess of 50 % set forth in Appendix C to this Agreement.\n(b) Amendments\nUpon the entry into force of this Agreement, Schedule XX shall be amended:\n(i) by striking out General Note 3(f); this repeals, as of the effective date of the amendment, the provision for interruption of the staging of the concessions provided for in the items listed in Appendix B; and after such date the effectiveness of such concessions (including any further staging thereof) shall be. governed by the provisions of General Note 3, computing any relevant time periods from the effective date of the original concessions, as though there had . been no provision for interruption of staging, and\n(ii) by striking out the rate in each item in Schedule XX (original concession) which has the same item number as an item set forth in Appendix C, and in each case inserting in lieu thereof the rate in such item in Appendix C (substitute concession exceeding 50 %).\nSUB-PART B \u2014 STAGING OF SUBSTITUTE CONCESSIONS\nArticles 5\nCoordination of Staging\n(a) Explanation\nThis Article provides for the staging of the substitute converted concessions provided for in Appendix A and of the substitute concessions exceeding 50 % provided for in Appendix C. It does so by inserting a new General Note 3(f) in Schedule XX and by adding a new Annex I-A to that Schedule. New General Note 3(f) assimilates the staging of the substitute concessions with the staging of the original concessions for which they are substituted. Although rates will be changed by the amendment, the time periods and relative amounts of reduction in effect on any day after the entry into force of this amendment will be the same for the substitute concessions as they would have been for the original concessions. Appendix D to this Agreement, which contains the new Annex I\u2013A to Schedule XX sets forth, for both kinds of substitute concessions rates applicable during the first, second, third, and fourth years of staging, computed from the date of the original concessions.\n(b) Amendments\nUpon the entry into force of this Agreement, Schedule XX shall be amended:\n(i) by striking out \"paragraphs (d) (ii) and (f)\" in the first sentence of General Note 3 (a), and by inserting in lieu thereof \"paragraph (d) (ii)\",\n(ii) by striking out \"In the case of each staged rate\", in General Note 3(b), and by inserting in lieu thereof:\n\"Special provisions regarding rates in Section 4, Chapter 1, Unites B and C, and regarding rates followed by three asterisks are set forth in paragraph (f) of this Note. In the case of each other rate which is a staged rate\",\n(iii) by inserting the following new paragraph (f) in General Note 3:\n\"(f) This paragraph relates to the staging of full concession rates inserted in this Schedule by the Agreement Relating Principally to Chemicals, Supplementary to the Geneva (1967) Protocol to the General Agreement. In the case of any such rate in this Schedule which is followed by two asterisks, the full concession rate becomes effective on the day on which Schedule XX is amended to include such rate. In the case of each full concession rate in Section 4, Chapter 1, Unites B and C, and in the case of each full concession rate which is followed by three asterisks, the rates applicable during the first, second, third, and fourth years of staging are set forth in Annex I\u2013A to this Schedule. The first, second, third, and fourth years of staging in that Annex coincide with the corresponding years of staging of the original concession rates, i.e., they are computed for each converted rate from the effective date of the original concessions. Consequently, if a rate is inserted in Schedule XX on any day prior to 1 January 1969, the rate which becomes applicable on and after that day is the rate for the same stage, under the substitute concession, as the stage for the rate it replaces under the original concession.

Commercial purchases and supply commitments\n1. Each member country when exporting wheat undertakes to do so at prices consistent with the price range.\n2. Each member country importing wheat undertakes that the maximum possible share of its total commercial purchases of wheat in any crop year shall be purchased from member countries, except as provided in paragraph 4 below. This share will have to be determined at a later stage and will be dependent upon the extent to which other countries accede to the Arrangement.\n3.

Role of minimum prices\nThe purpose of the schedule of minimum prices is to contribute to market stability by making it possible to determine when the level of market prices for any wheat is at or approaching the minimum of the range. Since price relationships between types and qualities of wheat fluctuate with competitive circumstances, provision is made for review of and adjustments in minimum prices, on the basis of the following principles:\n1. If the Secretariat of the Grains Council in the course of its continuous review of market conditions is of the opinion that a situation has arisen, or threatens imminently to arise, which appears to jeopardize the objectives of the Arrangement with regard to the minimum price provisions, or if such a situation is called to the attention of the Secretariat of the Council by any member country, the Executive Secretary shall convene a meeting of the Prices Review Committee within two days and concurrently notify all member countries.\n2. The Prices Review Committee shall review the price situation with the view to reaching agreement on action required by member participants to restore price stability and to maintain prices at or above minimum levels and shall notify the Executive Secretary when agreement has been reached and of the action taken to restore market stability.\n3. If after three market days the Prices Review Committee is unable to reach agreement on the action to be taken to restore market stability, the Chairman of the Council shall convene a meeting of the Council within two days to consider what further measures might be taken. If after not more than three days of review by the Council any member country is exporting or offering wheat below the minimum prices as determined by the Council, the Council shall decide whether provisions of the agreement shall be suspended and if so to what extent.\n4. When any minimum price has been adjusted in accordance with the foregoing, such adjustments shall terminate when the Prices Review Committee or the Council finds that the conditions requiring the adjustments no longer prevail.\n5. Denatured wheat shall be excluded from the provisions relating to minimum prices.\nV. International food aid\n1. The countries party to this Agreement agree to contribute wheat, coarse grains, or the cash equivalent thereof, as aid to the developing countries, to an amount of 4,5 million metric tons of grain annually. Grains covered by the programme shall be suitable for human consumption and of an acceptable type and quality.\n2. The minimum contribution of each country party to this Agreement is fixed as follows:\n| % | (\u2018000 metric tons) |\nUnited States | 42,0 | 1890 |\nCanada | 11,0 | 495 |\nAustralia | 5,0 | 225 |\nArgentina | 0,5 | 23 |\nEEC | 23,0 | 1035 |\nUnited Kingdom | 5,0 | 225 |\nSwitzerland | 0,7 | 32 |\nSweden | 1,2 | 54 |\nDenmark | 0,6 | 27 |\nNorway | 0,3 | 14 |\nFinland | 0,3 | 14 |\nJapan | 5,0 | 225 |\nCountries acceding to the Arrangement may make contributions on such a basis as may be agreed.\n3. The contribution of a country making the whole or part of its contribution to the programme in the form of cash shall be calculated by evaluating the quantity determined for that country (or that portion of the quantity not contributed in grain) at US$1.73 per bushel.\n4. Food aid in the form of grain shall be supplied on the following terms:\n(a) Sales for the currency of the importing country which is not transferable and is not convertible into currency or goods and services for use by the contributing country. [1]\n(b) A gift of grain or a monetary grant used to purchase grain for the importing country.\nGrain purchases shall be made from participating countries. In the use of grant funds, special regard shall be had to facilitating grain exports of developing member countries. To this end priority shall be given so that not less than 25 % of the cash contribution to purchase grain for food aid or that part of such contribution required to purchase 200000 metric tons of grain shall be used to purchase grains produced in developing countries. Contributions in the form of grains shall be placed in fob forward position by donor countries.\n5. Countries party to the Arrangement may, in respect of their . contribution to the food aid programme, specify a recipient country or countries.\nVI. Miscellaneous\nA grains arrangement must include, among other things, acceptable provisions relating to such issues as voting rights, definition of commercial transactions, guidelines for non-commercial transactions, safeguards for commercial transactions, and provisions concerning wheat flour which take into account the special nature of international trade in flour.\nVII.

In the case of a re-sale, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply if the wheat originated in the country of origin during the same crop year. \n 5. The Council may authorize purchases to be recorded for a crop year if:    (a) the loading period involved is within a reasonable time up to one month, to be decided by the Council, before the beginning or after the end of that crop year ; and \n      (b) the two members concerned so agree. \n \n \n 6.

Estimates submitted in accordance with this Article shall in no way be binding. \n \n Article 6\n Consultations on market conditions \n 1. If the Advisory Subcommittee on Market Conditions, in the course of its continuous review of the market under paragraph 2 of Article 16, is of the opinion that a situation of market instability, has arisen or threatens imminently to arise, or if such a situation is called to the Advisory Subcommittee''s attention by the Executive Secretary on his own initiative or at the request of any exporting or importing member, it shall immediately report the facts concerned to the Executive Committee. The Advisory Subcommittee shall in so informing the Executive Committee give particular regard to those circumstances which have brought about, or threaten to bring about, the situation of market instability, including price fluctuations. The Executive Committee shall meet within five market days to review the situation and to consider whether it would be possible to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions. \n 2. The Executive Committee shall, if it considers it appropriate, inform the Chairman of the Council who may convene a session of the Council to review the situation. \n \n Article 7\n Disputes and complaints \n 1.

In such a case, the Council shall immediately consult with the members concerned in order to resolve the matter. If the matter is not resolved through such consultations, the Council shall consider the matter further and may make recommendations to the members concerned. \n \n Article 8\n Annual review of the world wheat situation \n 1.    (a) In the furtherance of the objectives of this Convention as set forth in Article 1, the Council shall annually review the world wheat situation and shall inform members of the effects upon the international trade in wheat of the facts which emerge from the review, in order that these effects be kept in mind by these members in determining and administering their internal agricultural and price policies. \n      (b) The review shall be carried out in the light of information obtainable in relation to national production, stocks, consumption, prices and trade, including both commercial and special transactions, of wheat. \n      (c) Each member may submit to the Council information which is relevant to the annual review of the world wheat situation and is not already available to the Council either directly or through the appropriate organization in the United Nations system including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). \n \n 2. In carrying out the annual review, the Council shall consider the means through which the consumption of wheat may be increased, and may undertake, in cooperation with members, studies of such matters as:    (a) factors affecting the consumption of wheat in various countries, and \n      (b) means of achieving increased consumption, particularly in countries where the possibility of increased consumption is found to exist.  \n \n \n 3. For the purposes of this Article, the Council shall take into account work done on grains by UNCTAD and the FAO and by other intergovernmental organizations, in order to avoid duplication of work, and may, without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 1 of Article 20, make such arrangements regarding cooperation in any of its activities as it considers desirable with such intergovernmental organizations and also with any Governments of members of the United Nations or of the specialized agencies not party to this Convention which have a substantial interest in the international trade in grains. \n 4. Nothing in this Article shall prejudice the complete liberty of action of any member in the determination and administration of its internal agricultural and price policies. \n \n Article 9\n Guidelines relating to concessional transactions \n 1. Members undertake to conduct any concessional transactions in wheat in such a way as to avoid harmful interference with normal patterns of production and international commercial trade. \n 2. To this end members shall undertake appropriate measures to ensure that concessional transactions are additional to commercial sales which could reasonably be anticipated in the absence of such transactions. Such measures shall be consistent with the Principles of Surplus Disposal and Guiding Lines recommended by the FAO and may provide that a specified level of commercial imports of wheat, agreed with the recipient country, be maintained on a global basis by that country. In establishing or adjusting this level full regard shall be had to the commercial import levels in a representative period and to the economic circumstances of the recipient country, including, in particular, its balance-of-payments situation. \n 3. Members, when engaging in concessional export transactions, shall consult with exporting members whose commercial sales might be affected by such transactions, to the maximum possible extent before such arrangements are concluded with recipient countries. \n 4. The Executive Committee shall furnish an annual report to the Council on developments in concessional transactions in wheat. \n \n \n   PART II ADMINISTRATION\n  Article 10\n Constitution of the Council \n 1.

WESTERTERP   \n \n    AGREEMENT  between the European Economic Community  and the Republic of Austria \n \n THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, \n of the one part, and \n THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA, \n of the other part, \n DESIRING to consolidate and to extend, upon the enlargement of the European Economic Community, the economic relations existing between the Community and Austria and to ensure, with due regard for fair conditions of competition, the harmonious development of their commerce, \n RESOLVED to this end to eliminate progressively the obstacles to substantially all their trade, in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concerning the establishment of free trade areas, \n DECLARING their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, and in particular of developments in the Community, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations where it would appear to be useful in the interests of their economies to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement, \n HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of these objectives and considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from the obligations which are incumbent upon them under other international agreements, \n TO CONCLUDE THIS AGREEMENT:\n \n   Article 1\n The aim of this Agreement is:    (a) to promote through the expansion of reciprocal trade the harmonious development of economic relations between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Austria and thus to foster in the Community and in Austria the advance of economic activity, the improvement of living and employment conditions, and increased productivity and financial stability, \n      (b) to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between the Contracting Parties, \n      (c) to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. \n \n \n \n Article 2\n 1. The Agreement shall apply to products originating in the Community or Austria:    (i) which fall within Chapters 25 to 99 of the Brussels Nomenclature, excluding the products listed in the Annex; \n      (ii) which are specified in Protocol No 2, with due regard to the arrangements provided for in that Protocol. \n \n \n 2. The Agreement shall replace the Interim Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Austria signed this same day. \n \n Article 3\n 1. No new customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Austria.  \n 2. Without prejudice to the tariff reductions made under Article 2 (2) of the Interim Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Austria signed this same day, customs duties on imports shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the following timetable:    (a) on 1 January 1974 each duty shall be reduced to 60 % of the basic duty; \n      (b) three further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on: \n 1 January 1975, \n 1 January 1976, \n 1 July 1977. \n \n \n As regards trade between Ireland and Austria, an initial reduction shall be made on 1 April 1973 to reduce each customs duty on imports to 80 % of the basic duty. \n \n Article 4\n 1. The provisions concerning the progressive abolition of customs duties on imports shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. \n The Contracting Parties may replace a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty by an internal tax. \n 2. Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom may retain until 1 January 1976 a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty in the event of implementation of Article 38 of the \"Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties\" drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \n \n Article 5\n 1. The basic duty to which the successive reductions provided for in Article 3 and in Protocol No 1 are to be applied shall, for each product, be the duty actually applied on 1 January 1972. \n 2. If, after 1 January 1972, any tariff reductions resulting from the tariff agreements concluded as a result of the Trade Conference held in Geneva from 1964 to 1967 become applicable, such reduced duties shall replace the basic duties referred to in paragraph 1. \n 3. The reduced duties calculated in accordance with Article 3 and Protocol No 1 shall be applied rounded to the first decimal place. \n Subject to the application by the Community of Article 39 (5) of the \"Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties\" drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as regards the specific duties or the specific part of the mixed duties in the Irish Customs Tariff, Article 3 and Protocol No 1 shall be applied, with rounding to the fourth decimal place. \n \n Article 6\n 1. No new charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Austria. \n 2. Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports introduced on or after 1 January 1972 in trade between the Community and Austria shall be abolished upon the entry into force of the Agreement. \n Any charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports, the rate of which on 31 December 1972 is higher than that actually applied on 1 January 1972, shall be reduced to the latter rate upon the entry into force of the Agreement. \n 3. Without prejudice to the reductions made under Article 2 (2) of the Interim Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Austria signed this same day, charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the following timetable:    (a) by 1 January 1974 at the latest each charge shall be reduced to 60 % of the rate applied on 1 January 1972; \n      (b) three further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on: \n 1 January 1975, \n 1 January 1976, \n 1 July 1977. \n \n \n As regards trade between Ireland and Austria, an initial reduction shall be made on 1 April 1973 to reduce each charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports to 80 % of the basic duty. \n \n Article 7\n No customs duty on exports or charge having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Austria.  \n Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be abolished not later than 1 January 1974. \n \n Article 8\n Protocol No 1 lays down the tariff treatment and arrangements applicable to certain products. \n \n Article 9\n Protocol No 2 lays down the tariff treatment and arrangements applicable to certain goods obtained by processing agricultural products. \n \n Article 10\n 1. In the event of specific rules being established as a result of the implementation of its agricultural policy or of any alteration of the current rules the Contracting Party in question may adapt the arrangements resulting from this Agreement in respect of the products which are the subject of those rules or alterations. \n 2. In such cases the Contracting Party in question shall take due account of the interests of the other Contracting Party. To this end the Contracting Parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 29. \n \n Article 11\n Protocol No 3 lays down the rules of origin. \n \n Article 12\n A Contracting Party which is considering the reduction of the effective level of its duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to third countries benefiting from most-favoured-nation treatment, or which is considering the suspension of their application, shall, as far as may be practicable, notify the Joint Committee not less than thirty days before such reduction or suspension comes into effect. It shall take note of any representations by the other Contracting Party regarding any distortions which might result therefrom. \n \n Article 13\n 1. No new quantitative restriction on imports or measures having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Austria. \n 2. Quantitative restrictions on imports shall be abolished on 1 January 1973 and any measures having an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions on imports shall be abolished not later than 1 January 1975. \n \n Article 14\n 1. The Community reserves the right to modify the arrangements applicable to the petroleum products falling within headings Nos 27.10, 27.11, 27.12, ex 27.13 (paraffin wax, micro-crystalline wax, or bituminous shale and other mineral waxes) and 27.14 of the Brussels Nomenclature upon adoption of a common definition of origin for petroleum products, upon adoption of decisions under the common commercial policy for the products in question or upon establishment of a common energy policy. \n In this event the Community shall take due account of the interests of Austria ; to this end it shall inform the Joint Committee, which shall meet under the conditions set out in Article 31. \n 2. Austria reserves the right to take similar action should it be faced with like situations. \n 3. Subject to paragraphs 1 and 2, the Agreement shall not prejudice the non-tariff rules applied to imports of petroleum products. \n \n Article 15\n 1. The Contracting Parties declare their readiness to foster, so far as their agricultural policies allow, the harmonious development of trade in agricultural products to which the Agreement does not apply. \n 2. The Contracting Parties shall apply their agricultural rules in veterinary, health and plant health matters in a non-discriminatory fashion and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly obstructing trade. \n 3. The Contracting Parties shall examine, under the conditions set out in Article 31, any difficulties that might arise in their trade in agricultural products and shall endeavour to seek appropriate solutions. \n \n Article 16\n From 1 July 1977 products originating in Austria may not enjoy more favourable treatment when imported into the Community than that applied by the Member States of the Community between themselves.  \n \n Article 17\n The Agreement shall not preclude the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade, except in so far as they alter the trade arrangements provided for in the Agreement, in particular the provisions concerning the rules of origin. \n \n Article 18\n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination between the products of one Contracting Party and like products originating in the territory of the other Contracting Party. \n Products exported to the territory of one of the Contracting Parties may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. \n \n Article 19\n Payments relating to trade in goods and the transfer of such payments to the Member State of the Community in which the creditor is resident or to Austria shall be free from any restrictions. \n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any exchange or administrative restrictions on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short- and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident participates. \n \n Article 20\n The Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, law and order or public security, the protection of life and health of humans, animals or plants, the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value, the protection of industrial and commercial property, or rules relating to gold or silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions must not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties. \n \n Article 21\n Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures:    (a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; \n      (b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defence purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes; \n      (c) which it considers essential to its own security in time of war or serious international tension. \n \n \n \n Article 22\n 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure likely to jeopardize the fulfilment of the objectives of the Agreement. \n 2. They shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. \n If either Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27. \n \n Article 23\n 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Austria:    (i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition as regards the production of or trade in goods; \n      (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Contracting Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof,  \n      (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. \n \n \n 2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27. \n \n Article 24\n Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is due to:    (i) the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party, as provided for in the Agreement, of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question ; and \n      (ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party; \n \n \n the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27. \n \n Article 25\n If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27. \n \n Article 26\n If serious disturbances arise in any sector of the economy or if difficulties arise which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27. \n \n Article 27\n 1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 24 and 26 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Contracting Party. \n 2. In the cases specified in Articles 22 to 26, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3 (d) applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties. \n In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. \n The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. \n 3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:    (a) As regards Article 23, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement within the meaning of Article 23 (1). \n The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to. \n If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in question ; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions. \n      (b) As regards Article 24 the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties.  \n If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported. \n The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein. \n      (c) As regards Article 25, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures. \n      (d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 24, 25 and 26 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to deal with the situation. \n \n \n \n Article 28\n Where one or more Member States of the Community or Austria is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith. \n \n Article 29\n 1. A Joint Committee is hereby established, which shall be responsible for the administration of the Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose, it shall make recommendations and take decisions in the cases provided for in the Agreement. These decisions shall be put into effect by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own rules. \n 2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement the Contracting Parties shall exchange information and, at the request of either Party, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee. \n 3. The Joint Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure. \n \n Article 30\n 1. The Joint Committee shall consist of representatives of the Community, on the one hand, and of representatives of Austria, on the other. \n 2. The Joint Committee shall act by mutual agreement. \n \n Article 31\n 1. Each Contracting Party shall preside in turn over the Joint Committee, in accordance with the arrangements to be laid down in its rules of procedure. \n 2. The Chairman shall convene meetings of the Joint Committee at least once a year in order to review the general functioning of the Agreement. \n The Joint Committee shall, in addition, meet whenever special circumstances so require, at the request of either Contracting Party, in accordance with the conditions to be laid down in its rules of procedure. \n 3. The Joint Committee may decide to set up any working party that can assist it in carrying out its duties. \n \n Article 32\n 1. Where a Contracting Party considers that it would be useful in the interest of the economies of both Contracting Parties to develop the relations established by the Agreement by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned request to the other Contracting Party. \n The Contracting Parties may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening negotiations. \n 2. The agreements resulting from the negotiations referred to in paragraph 1 will be subject to ratification or approval by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own procedures. \n \n Article 33\n The Annex and Protocols to the Agreement shall form an integral part thereof. \n \n Article 34\n Either Contracting Party may denounce the Agreement by notifying the other Contracting Party. The Agreement shall cease to be in force twelve months after the date of such notification.  \n \n Article 35\n The Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories to which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community applies upon the terms laid down in that Treaty and, on the other, to the territory of the Republic of Austria. \n \n Article 36\n This Agreement is drawn up in duplicate, in the Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Norwegian languages, each of these texts being equally authentic. \n This Agreement will be approved by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own procedures. \n It shall enter into force on 1 January 1973, provided that the Contracting Parties have notified each other before that date that the procedures necessary to this end have been completed. \n After this date this Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following such notification. The final date for such notification shall be 30 November 1973. \n The provisions applicable on 1 April 1973 shall be applied upon the entry into force of this Agreement if it enters into force after that date.\n \n \n   Udf\u00e6rdiget i Bruxelles, den toogtyvende juli nitten hundrede og tooghalvfjerds. \n Geschehen zu Br\u00fcssel am zweiundzwanzigsten Juli neunzehnhundertzweiundsiebzig. \n Done at Brussels on this twenty-second day of July in the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two. \n Fait \u00e0 Bruxelles, le vingt-deux juillet mil neuf cent soixante-douze. \n Fatto a Bruxelles, il ventidue luglio millenovecentosettantadue. \n Gedaan te Brussel, de twee\u00ebntwintigste juli negentienhonderdtwee\u00ebnzeventig. \n Utferdiget i Brussel, tjueandre juli nitten hundre og syttito.  \n P\u00e5 R\u00e5det for De europ\u00e6iske F\u00e6llesskabers vegne \n Im Namen des Rates der Europ\u00e4ischen Gemeinschaften \n In the name of the Council of the European Communities \n Au nom du Conseil des Communaut\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes \n A nome del Consiglio delle Comunit\u00e0 europee \n Namens de Raad van de Europese Gemeenschappen \n For R\u00e5det for De Europeiske Fellesskap >PIC FILE= \"T0010759\">  \n \n \nANNEX List of products referred to in Article 2 of the Agreement\n  >PIC FILE= \"T0010760\">"'

In such cases the Contracting Party in question shall take due account of the interests of the other Contracting Party. To this end the Contracting Parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 29. \n \n Article 11\n Protocol No 3 lays down the rules of origin.  \n \n Article 12\n A Contracting Party which is considering the reduction of the effective level of its duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to third countries benefiting from most-favoured-nation treatment, or which is considering the suspension of their application, shall, as far as may be practicable, notify the Joint Committee not less than thirty days before such reduction or suspension comes into effect. It shall take note of any representations by the other Contracting Party regarding any distortions which might result therefrom. \n \n Article 13\n 1. No new quantitative restriction on imports or measures having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Sweden. \n 2.

The Contracting Parties declare their readiness to foster, so far as their agricultural policies allow, the harmonious development of trade in agricultural products to which the Agreement does not apply. \n 2. The Contracting Parties shall apply their agricultural rules in veterinary, health and plant health matters in a non-discriminatory fashion and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly obstructing trade. \n 3. The Contracting Parties shall examine, under the conditions set out in Article 31, any difficulties that might arise in their trade in agricultural products and shall endeavour to seek appropriate solutions. \n \n Article 16\n From 1 July 1977 products originating in Sweden may not enjoy more favourable treatment when imported into the Community than that applied by the Member States of the Community between themselves. \n \n Article 17\n The Agreement shall not preclude the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade, except in so far as they alter the trade arrangements provided for in the Agreement, in particular the provisions concerning rules of origin. \n \n Article 18\n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination between the products of one Contracting Party and like products originating in the territory of the other Contracting Party. \n Products exported to the territory of one of the Contracting Parties may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. \n \n Article 19\n Payments relating to trade in goods and the transfer of such payments to the Member State of the Community in which the creditor is resident or to Sweden shall be free from any restrictions. \n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any exchange or administrative restrictions on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short- and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident participates. \n \n Article 20\n The Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, law and  order or public security, the protection of life and health of humans, animals or plants, the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value, the protection of industrial and commercial property, or rules relating to gold or silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions must not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties. \n \n Article 21\n Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures:    (a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; \n      (b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defence purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes; \n      (c) which it considers essential to its own security in time of war or serious international tension. \n \n \n \n Article 22\n 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure likely to jeopardize the fulfilment of the objectives of the Agreement. \n 2. They shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. \n If either Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27. \n \n Article 23\n 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Sweden:    (i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition as regards the production of or trade in goods; \n      (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Contracting Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; \n      (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. \n \n \n 2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27. \n \n Article 24\n Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is due to:    (i) the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party, as provided for in the Agreement, of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question ; and \n      (ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party; \n \n \n the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27. \n \n Article 25\n If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27. \n \n Article 26\n If serious disturbances arise in any sector of the economy or if difficulties arise which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27.  \n \n Article 27\n 1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 24 and 26 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Contracting Party. \n 2. In the cases specified in Articles 22 to 26, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3(d) applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties. \n In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. \n The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. \n 3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:    (a) As regards Article 23, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement within the meaning of Article 23(1). \n The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to. \n If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practice in question ; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions. \n      (b) As regards Article 24, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties. \n If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported. \n The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein. \n      (c) As regards Article 25, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures. \n      (d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 24, 25 and 26 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. \n \n \n \n Article 28\n Where one or more Member States of the Community or Sweden is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith. \n \n Article 29\n 1. A Joint Committee is hereby established, which shall be responsible for the administration of the Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose, it shall make recommendations and take decisions in the cases provided for in the Agreement. These decisions shall be put into effect by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own rules. \n 2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement the Contracting Parties shall exchange information and, at the request of either Party, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee. \n 3. The Joint Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure. \n \n Article 30\n 1. The Joint Committee shall consist of representatives of the Community, on the one hand, and of representatives of Sweden, on the other. \n 2. The Joint Committee shall act by mutual agreement.  \n \n Article 31\n 1. Each Contracting Party shall preside in turn over the Joint Committee, in accordance with the arrangements to be laid down in its rules of procedure. \n 2. The Chairman shall convene meetings of the Joint Committee at least once a year in order to review the general functioning of the Agreement. \n The Joint Committee shall, in addition, meet whenever special circumstances so require, at the request of either Contracting Party, in accordance with the conditions to be laid down in its rules of procedure. \n 3. The Joint Committee may decide to set up any working party that can assist it in carrying out its duties. \n \n Article 32\n 1. Where a Contracting Party considers that it would be useful in the common interest of both Contracting Parties to develop the relations established by the Agreement by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned request to the other Contracting Party. \n The Contracting Parties may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening negotiations. These recommendations may, where appropriate, aim at the attainment of a concerted harmonization, provided that the autonomy of decision of the two Contracting Parties is not impaired. \n 2. The agreements resulting from the negotiations referred to in paragraph 1 will be subject to ratification or approval by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own procedures. \n \n Article 33\n The Annex and Protocols to the Agreement shall form an integral part thereof. \n \n Article 34\n Either Contracting Party may denounce the Agreement by notifying the other Contracting Party. The Agreement shall cease to be in force twelve months after the date of such notification. \n \n Article 35\n The Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories to which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community applies upon the terms laid down in that Treaty and, on the other, to the territory of the Kingdom of Sweden. \n \n Article 36\n This Agreement is drawn up in duplicate, in the Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Norwegian and Swedish languages, each of these texts being equally authentic. \n This Agreement will be approved by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own procedures. \n It shall enter into force on 1 January 1973, provided that the Contracting Parties have notified each other before that date that the procedures necessary to this end have been completed. \n After this date this Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following such notification. The final date for such notification shall be 30 November 1973. \n The provisions applicable on 1 April 1973 shall be applied upon the entry into force of this Agreement if it enters into force after that date.\n \n \n   Udf\u00e6rdiget i Bruxelles, den toogtyvende juli nitten hundrede og tooghalvfjerds. \n Geschehen zu Br\u00fcssel am zweiundzwanzigsten Juli neunzehnhundertzweiundsiebzig. \n Done at Brussels on this twenty-second day of July in the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two. \n Fait \u00e0 Bruxelles, le vingt-deux juillet mil neuf cent soixante-douze. \n Fatto a Bruxelles, il ventidue luglio millenovecentosettantadue. \n Gedaan te Brussel, de twee\u00ebntwintigste juli negentienhonderdtwee\u00ebnzeventig. \n Utferdiget i Brussel, tjueandre juli nitten hundre og syttito. \n Som skedde i Bryssel den tjugoandra juli nittonhundrasjuttiotv\u00e5.  \n P\u00e5 R\u00e5det for De europ\u00e6iske F\u00e6llesskabers vegne \n Im Namen des Rates der Europ\u00e4ischen Gemeinschaften \n In the name of the Council of the European Communities \n Au nom du Conseil des Communaut\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes \n A nome del Consiglio delle Comunit\u00e0 europee \n Namens de Raad van de Europese Gemeenschappen \n For R\u00e5det for De Europeiske Fellesskap >PIC FILE= \"T0010675\">  \n \n \nANNEX List of products referred to in Article 2 of the Agreement\n >PIC FILE= \"T0010676\">"'

Such prohibitions or restrictions must not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties.\nArticle 21\nNothing in the Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures:\n(a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests;\n(b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defence purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes;\n(c) which it considers essential to its own security in time of war or serious international tension.\nArticle 22\n1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure likely to jeopardize the fulfilment of the objectives of the Agreement.\n2.

In the cases specified in Articles 22 to 26, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3(d) applies, as soon as pos sible the Contracting Party in question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties.\nIn the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement.\nThe safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.\n3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:\n(a) As regards Article 23, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement within the meaning of Article 23 (1).\nThe Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to.\nIf the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in question; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions.\n(b) As regards Article 24, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties.\nIf the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported.\nThe compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein.\n(c) As regards Article 25, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures.\n(d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 24, 25 and 26 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.\nArticle 28\nWhere one or more Member States of the Community or Switzerland is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith.\nArticle 29\n1. A Joint Committee is hereby established, which shall be responsible for the administration of the Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation.

This condition shall not apply, however, to products which, within the meaning of this Protocol, originate in Switzerland;\n2. products originating in Switzerland:\n(a) products wholly obtained in Switzerland,\n(b) products obtained in Switzerland in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5. This condition shall not apply, however, to products which, within the meaning of this Protocol, originate in the Community.\nThe products in List C shall be temporarily excluded from the scope of this Protocol.\nArticle 2\n1. Inasmuch as trade between the Community and Austria, Finland, Iceland, Portugal and Sweden and between Switzerland and the latter five countries and also between each of those five countries themselves is governed by agreements containing rules identical to those in this Protocol, the following products shall also be considered as:\nA. products originating in the Community: those products referred to in Article 1(1) which, after being exported from the Community, have undergone no working or processing in any of those five countries or have not undergone sufficient working or processing there to confer on them the status of products originating in any of those countries by virtue of provisions corresponding to those of Article l(l)(b) or (2)(b) of this Protocol contained in the agreements referred to above, provided that:\n(a) only products originating in any of those five countries or in the Community or in Switzerland have been used in the course of the working or processing,\n(b) where a percentage rule limits, in the Lists A or B referred to in Article 5, the proportion in value of non-originating products that can be incorporated under certain cirumstances, the added value has been acquired in each of the countries in accordance with the percentage rules and with the other rules contained in the said lists without any possibility of cumulation from one country to another;\nB. products originating in Switzerland: those products referred to in Article 1(2) which, after being exported from Switzerland, have undergone no working or processing in any one of these five countries or have undergone working or processing insufficient to confer on them the status of products originating in any of those countries by virtue of provisions corresponding to those of Article l(l)(b) or (2)(b) of this Protocol contained in the agreements referred to above, provided that:\n(a) only products originating in any one of those five countries or in the Community or in Switzerland have been used in the course of the working or processing,\n(b) where a percentage rule limits, in the Lists A or B referred to in Article 5, the proportion in value of non-originating products that can be incorporated under certain circumstances, the added value has been acquired in each of the countries in accordance with the percentage rules and with the other rules contained in the said lists without any possibility of cumulation from one country to another.\n2. For the purpose of implementing paragraph 1(A)(a) and (B)(a), the fact that products other than those referred to in that paragraph are used in a proportion not exceeding in total value 5 % of the value of the products obtained and imported into Switzerland or the Community does not affect the determination of origin of the latter products, provided that they would not have caused the products exported from the Community or Switzerland in the first place to lose their status of products originating in the Community or in Switzerland had they been incorporated there.\n3. In the cases referred to in paragraph l(A)(b) and (B)(b) and paragraph 2, no non-originating product may be incorporated if it only undergoes the working or processing provided for in Article 5(3).\nArticle 3\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 and provided that all the conditions laid down in that article are nevertheless fulfilled, the products obtained shall not continue to be considered as products originating in the Community or in Switzerland respectively unless the value of the products worked or processed originating in the Community or in Switzerland represents the highest percentage of the value of the products obtained. If this is not so, the latter products are considered as originating in the country where the added value acquired represents the highest percentage of their value.\nArticle 4\nThe following shall be considered as wholly obtained either in the Community or in Switzerland within the meaning of Article l(l)(a) and (2)(a):\n(a) Mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;\n(b) Vegetable products harvested there;\n(c) Live animals born and raised there;\n(d) Products from live animals raised there;\n(e) Products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;\n(f) Products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea by their vessels;\n(g) Products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph (f);\n(h) Used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials;\n(i) Waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;\n(j) Goods produced there exclusively from products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (i).\nArticle 5\n1. For the purpose of implementing Article 1(1) (b) and (2)(b) the following shall be considered as sufficient working or processing:\n(a) working or processing as a result of which the goods obtained receive a classification under a tariff heading other than that covering each of the products worked or processed, except, however, working or processing specified in List A, where the special provisions of that list apply;\n(b) working or processing specified in List B.\n\"Sections\", \"Chapters\" and \"tariff headings\" shall mean the Sections, Chapters and tariff headings in the Brussels Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs.\n2. When, for a given product obtained, a percentage rule limits in List A and in List B the value of the materials and parts which can be used, the total value of these materials and parts, whether or not they have changed tariff heading in the course of the working, processing or assembly within the limits and under the conditions laid down in each of those two lists, may not exceed, in relation to the value of the product obtained, the value corresponding either to the common rate, if the rates are identical in both lists, or to the higher of the two if they are different.\n3. For the purpose of implementing Article l(l)(b) and (2)(b), the following shall still be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating product, whether or not there is a change of tariff heading:\n(a) operations to ensure the preservation of merchandise in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);\n(b) simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;\n(c) (i) changes of packing and breaking up and assembly of consignments;\n(ii) simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, etc., and all other simple packing operations;\n(d) affixing marks, labels or other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;\n(e) simple mixing of products, whether or not of\ndifferent kinds, where one or more components of the mixtures do not meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating either in the Community or in Switzerland;\n(f) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article;\n(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);\n(h) slaughter of animals.\nArticle 6\n1. Where the Lists A and B referred to in Article 5 provide that goods obtained in the Community or in Switzerland shall be considered as originating therein only if the value of the products worked or processed does not exceed a given percentage of the value of the goods obtained, the values to be taken into consideration for determining such percentage shall be:\n- on the one hand,\nas regards products whose importation can be proved: their customs value at the time of importation;\nas regards products of undetermined origin: the earliest ascertainable price paid for such products in the territory of the Contracting Party where manufacture takes place;\n- and on tne other hand,\nthe ex-works price of the goods obtained, less internal taxes refunded or refundable on exportation.\nThis Article also applies for the implementation of Articles 2 and 3.\n2. Where Articles 2 and 3 apply, \"added value acquired\" shall be understood as meaning the difference between the ex-works price of the goods obtained, less internal taxes refunded or refundable on exportation from the country concerned or from the Community and the customs value of all the products imported and worked or processed in that country or in the Community.\nArticle 7\nGoods originating in Switzerland or in the Community and constituting one single shipment which is not split up may be transported through territory other than that of the Community, Switzerland, Austria, Finland, Iceland, Portugal or Sweden, with should the occasion arise, transhipment or temporary warehousing in such territory, provided that the crossing of the latter territory is justified for geographical reasons, that the goods have remained under the surveillance of the Customs authorities in the country of transit or of warehousing, that they have not entered into the commerce of such countries nor been delivered for home use there and have not undergone operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.\nTITLE II\nArrangements for administrative cooperation\nArticle 8\n1.

Where Article 2 and, where appropriate, Article 3 are applied A.W.1 movement certificates, a specimen of which is given in Annex VI to this Protocol, shall be used. They shall be issued by the Customs authorities of each of the countries concerned where the goods have either been held before their re-exportation in the same state or undergone the working or processing referred to in Article 2, upon presentation of the movement certificates issued previously.\n3. In order that the Customs authorities may satisfy themselves as to the conditions in which the goods have been kept in the territory of each of the countries concerned in cases where they have not been placed in a bonded warehouse and are to be re-exported in the same state, the movement certificates issued earlier and presented on importation of the goods shall, at the request of the holder of the goods, be duly endorsed at the time of importation and thereafter every six months by the said authorities.\n4.

Where the term \"movement certificate\" or \"movement certificates\" is used in this Protocol and it is not specified whether the certificate or certificates concerned are of the type described in paragraph 1 or of the type described in paragraph 2, the relevant provisions shall apply equally to both types of certificate.\nArticle 9\nA movement certificate shall be issued only on application having been made in writing by the exporter, on the form prescribed for this purpose.\nArticle 10\n1. A movement certificate shall be issued by the Customs authorities of the exporting State when the goods to which at relates are exported.

In this case, the certificate shall bear a special reference to the conditions in which it was issued.\nA movement certificate may be issued only where it can serve as the documentary evidence required for the purpose of implementing the preferential treatment provided for in the Agreement.\n2. A movement certificate issued under the conditions laid down in Article 8(2) or (4) must bear\nreferences to the movement certificate or certificates issued earlier upon presentation of which it is issued.\n3.

A movement certificate which is submitted to the Customs authorities of the importing State after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit the certificate by the final date set is due to reasons of force majeure or exceptional circumstances.\nIn other cases of belated presentation, the Customs authorities of the importing State may accept the certificates where the goods have been submitted to them before the said final date.\n3. Movement certificates, whether or not endorsed in the conditions laid down in Article 8(3), shall be preserved by the Customs authorities of the importing State in accordance with the rules in force in that State.\nArticle 12\nMovement certificates shall be made out on the appropriate form, specimens of which are given in Annexes V and VI to this Protocol, in one of the languages in which this Agreement is drawn up, and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting State.

In the latter case, each certificate must include a reference to such approval. Each certificate must bear the name and address of the printer or a mark by which the printer can be identified. It shall also bear a serial number by which it can be identified.\nArticle 13\nMovement certificates shall be submitted to customs authorities in the importing State, in accordance with the procedures laid down by that State. The said authorities may require a translation of a certificate. They may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the goods meet the conditions required for the implementation of the Agreement.\nArticle 14\n1. The Community and Switzerland shall admit goods sent as small packages to private persons or forming part of travellers'' personal luggage, as originating products benefiting from the Agreement without requiring the production of a movement certificate provided that such goods are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the conditions required for the application of these provisions, and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such declaration.\n2. Importations which are occasional and consist solely of goods for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as importations by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the goods that no commercial purpose is in view. Furthermore, the total value of these goods must not exceed 60 units of account in the case of small packages or 200 units of account in the case of the contents of travellers'' personal luggage.\n3. The unit of account (UA) has a value of 0,88867088 grams of fine gold. Should the unit of account be changed, the Contracting Parties shall make contact with each other at Joint Committee level to re-define the value in terms of gold.\nArticle 15\n1. Goods sent from the Community or from Switzerland for exhibition in a country other thanthose referred to in Article 2 and sold after the exhibition for importation into Switzerland or into the Community shall benefit on importation from the provisions of the Agreement on condition that the goods meet the requirements of this Protocol entitling them to be recognized as originating in the Community or in Switzerland and provided that it is shown to the satisfaction of the Customs authorities that:\n(a) an exporter has consigned these goods from the Community or from Switzerland to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;\n(b) the goods have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to someone in Switzerland or in the Community;\n(c) the goods have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter to Switzerland or to the Community in the state in which they were sent for exhibition;\n(d) the goods have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.\n2. A movement certificate must be produced to the Customs authorities in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the nature of the goods and the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.\n3.

They also undertake to provide the administrative cooperation necessary for this purpose, in particular to check on the itinerary of goods traded under the agreements referred to in Article 2 and the places in which they have been held.\nArticle 23\n1. Without prejudice to Article 1 of Protocol No 2, no drawback or remission of any kind may be granted from customs duties in the Community or in Switzerland in respect of products used in manufacture which do not originate in the Community, Switzerland or the countries specified in Article 2 of this Protocol, as from the date on which the duty applicable to originating procucts of the same kind has been reduced in the Community and in Switzerland to 40 % of the basic duty.\n2. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No 2, no drawback or remission of any kind may be granted from customs duties in Denmark, Norway or the United Kingdom in respect of products imported and used in the manufacture of goods for which a movement certificate is issued by the Customs authorities of any of these three countries for the purpose of benefiting in Switzerland from the tariff provisions in force in Switzerland and covered by Article 3(1) of the Agreement. This rule does not, however, apply where the products used are those referred to in Article 25(1) of this Protocol.\n3. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No 2, no drawback or remission of any kind may be granted from customs duties in Switzerland in respect of imported products used in the manufacture of goods for which a movement certificate is issued by the Customs authorities of Switzerland for the purpose of benefiting in Denmark, Norway or the United Kingdom from the tariff provisions in force in these three countries and covered by Article 3(1) of the Agreement. This rule does not, however, apply where the products used are those referred to in Article 25(1) of this Protocol.\n4. In this and the following articles, the term \"customs duties\" also means charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties.\nArticle 24\n1. Movement certificates may, where appropriate, be required to indicate that the products to which they relate have acquired the status of originating products and have undergone any additional processing solely in Switzerland or in Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom or the other five countries specified in Article 2 of this Protocol until the dare from which the customs duties applicable to the said products are abolished between the Community as originally constituted and Ireland on the one hand, and Switzerland on the other hand.\n2. In other cases, they may, where appropriate, be required to indicate the added value acquired in each of the following territories:\n(i) the Community as originally constituted,\n(ii) Ireland,\n(iii) Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom,\n(iv) Switzerland,\n(v) each of the five countries specified in Article 2 of this Protocol.\nArticle 25\n1.

For the purpose of implementing Article 2(1) (A) of this Protocol, any product originating in one of the five countries referred to in that Article shall be treated as a non-originating product during the period or periods in which Switzerland applies the rate of duty applicable to third countries or any corresponding safeguard measure to that product in respect of the said country under the provisions governing trade between Switzerland and the five countries referred to in the aforementioned Article 2.\n2. For the purpose of implementing Article 2(1) (B) of this Protocol, any product originating in one of the five countries referred to in that Article shall be treated as a non-originating product during the period or periods in which the Community applies the rate of duty applicable to third countries to that product in respect of the said country under the Agreement concluded by the Community with that country.\nArticle 28\nThe Joint Committee may decide to amend the provisions of Title I, Article 5(3), of Title II, of Title III, Articles 23, 24 and 25 and of Annexes I, II, III, V and VI to this Protocol. It shall, in particular, be authorized to take any measures necessary to adapt them to the particular requirements of specific goods or certain forms of transport.\n--------------------------------------------------\nANNEX I\nEXPLANATORY NOTES\nNote 1 \u2014 Article 1\nThe terms \"the Community\" or \"Switzerland\" shall also cover the territorial waters of the Member States of the Community or of Switzerland respectively.\nVessels operating on the high seas, including factory ships, on which the fish caught is worked or processed shall be considered as part of the territory of the State to which they belong provided that they satisfy the conditions set out in Explanatory Note 5.\nNote 2 \u2014 Articles 1, 2 and 3\nIn order to determine whether goods originate in a Member State or in Switzerland or in one of the countries specified in Article 2, it shall not be necessary to establish whether the power and fuel, plant and equipment, and machines and tools used to obtain such goods originate in third countries or not.\nNote 3 \u2014 Articles 2 and 5\nFor the purpose of implementing the provisions of Article 2 paragraph 1 (A) (b) and (B) (b), the percentage rule must be observed by referring, for the added value acquired, to the provisions contained in Lists A and B. Where the product obtained appears in List A, the percentage rule therefore constitutes a criterion additional to that of change of tariff heading for any non-originating product used. Likewise the provisions ruling out the possibility of cumulating the percentages shown in Lists A and B for any one product obtained are applicable in each country for the added value acquired.\nNote 4 \u2014 Articles 1, 2 and 3\nPacking shall be considered as forming a whole with the goods contained therein. This provision, however, shall not apply to packing which is not of the normal type for the article packed and which has intrinsic utilization value and is of a durable nature, apart from its function as packing.\nNote 5 \u2014 Article 4(f)\nThe term \"their vessels\" shall apply only to vessels:\n(a) which are registered or recorded in a Member State of the Community or in Switzerland;\n(b) which sail under the flag of a Member State of the Community or of Switzerland;\n(c) which are at least 50 % owned by nationals of Member States of the Community or of Switzerland, or by a company with its head office in one of those States, of which the manager or managers, chairman of the board of directors or of the supervisory board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of the Member States of the Community or of Switzerland, and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to those States or to public bodies or nationals of the said States;\n(d) of which the captain and officers are all nationals of the Member States of the Community or of Switzerland;\n(e) of which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of the Member States of the Community or of Switzerland.\nNote 6 \u2014 Article 6\n\"Ex-works price\" shall mean the price paid to the manufacturer in whose undertaking the last working or processing is carried out, provided the price includes the value of all the products used in manufacture.\n\"Customs value\" shall be understood as meaning the customs value laid down in the Convention concerning the Valuation of Goods for Customs Purposes signed in Brussels on 15 December 1950.\nNote 7 \u2014 Article 8\nThe Customs authorities which endorse movement certificates in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 8(3) have the right to undertake verification of the goods in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in the State concerned.\nNote 8 \u2014 Article 10\nWhere a movement certificate relates to goods originally imported from a Member State of the Community or from Switzerland, and re-exported in the same state, the new certificates issued by the re-exporting State must, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 24, show in which State the original movement certificate was issued. Where the goods have not been placed in a bonded warehouse, the certificates must also show that the endorsements provided for in Article 8(3) have duly been made.\nNote 9 \u2014 Articles 16 and 22\nWhere a movement certificate has been issued under the conditions laid down in Article 8(2) or (4) and relates to goods re-exported in the same state, the Customs authorities of the country of destination must be able to obtain, by means of administrative cooperation, true copies of the movement certificate or certificates issued previously relating to those goods.\nNote 10 \u2014 Articles 23 and 25\n\"Tariff provisions in force\" small mean the duty applied on 1 January 1973 in Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom or Switzerland to the products referred to in Article 25(1) or the duty which, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, will be subsequently applied to the said products whenever this duty is lower than that applied to other products originating in the Community or in Switzerland.\nNote 11 \u2014 Article 23\n\"Drawback or remission of any kind granted from customs duties\" shall mean any arrangement for refund or remission, partial or complete, of customs duties applicable to products used in manufacture, provided that the said provision concedes, expressly or in effect, this repayment or non-charging or the non-imposition when goods obtained from the said products are exported but not when they are retained for home use.\nNote 12 \u2014 Articles 24 and 25\nArticle 24(1) and Article 25(1) shall mean, in particular, that application has not been made:\n(i) either of the provisions of the last sentence of Article l(2)(b) for products of the Community as originally constituted and of Ireland that have been worked or processed in Switzerland;\n(ii) or of any provisions corresponding to this sentence contained in the agreements referred to in Article 2 for products of the Comunity as originally constituted and of Ireland that are worked or processed in any of the five countries.\nNote 13 \u2014 Article 25\nWhere originating products not fulfilling the conditions laid down in Article 25(1) are imported into Denmark, Norway or the United Kingdom, the duty which serves as a basis for the tariff reductions provided for in Article 3(2) of the Agreement is that actually applied on 1 January 1972 by the importing country in respect of third countries.\n--------------------------------------------------\nANNEX II\nLIST A\nList of working or processing operations which result in a change of tariff heading without

President \n T. WESTERTERP   \n \n    AGREEMENT  between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland \n \n THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, \n of the one part, and \n THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND, \n of the other part, \n DESIRING to consolidate and to extend, upon the enlargement of the European Economic Community, the economic relations existing between the Community and Iceland and to ensure, with due regard for fair conditions of competition, the harmonious development of their commerce for the purpose of contributing to the work of constructing Europe, \n RESOLVED to this end to eliminate progressively the obstacles to substantially all their trade, in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concerning the establishment of free trade areas, \n DECLARING their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, and in particular of developments in the Community, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations where it would appear to be useful in the interests of their economies to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement, \n HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of these objectives and considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from the obligations which are incumbent upon them under other international agreements, \n TO CONCLUDE THIS AGREEMENT:\n \n   Article 1\n The aim of this Agreement is:    (a) to promote through the expansion of reciprocal trade the harmonious development of economic relations between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland and thus to foster in the Community and in Iceland the advance of economic activity, the improvement of living and employment conditions, and increased productivity and financial stability, \n      (b) to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between the Contracting Parties, \n      (c) to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. \n \n \n \n Article 2\n The Agreement shall apply to products originating in the Community or Iceland:    (i) which fall within Chapters 25 to 99 of the Brussels Nomenclature, excluding the products listed in Annex I; \n      (ii) which are specified in Protocols Nos 2 and 6, with due regard to the arrangements provided for in those Protocols. \n \n \n \n Article 3\n 1. No new customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Iceland. \n 2. The Community as originally constituted and Ireland shall progressively abolish customs duties on imports in accordance with the following timetable:     (a) on 1 April 1973 each duty shall be reduced to 80 % of the basic duty; \n      (b) four further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on: \n 1 January 1974, \n 1 January 1975, \n 1 January 1976, \n 1 July 1977. \n \n \n 3. The basic duty to which the successive reductions provided for in this Article and in Protocol No 1 are to be applied shall, for each product, be the duty actually applied on 1 January 1972. \n If, after 1 January 1972, any tariff reductions resulting from the tariff agreements concluded as a result of the Trade Conference held in Geneva from 1964 to 1967 become applicable, such reduced duties shall replace the basic duties referred to in the previous subparagraph. \n 4. The reduced duties calculated in accordance with this Article and Protocol No 1 shall be applied rounded to the first decimal place. \n Subject to the application by the Community of Article 39 (5) of the \"Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties\" drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as regards the specific duties or the specific part of the mixed duties in the Irish Customs Tariff, this Article and Protocol No 1 shall be applied, with rounding to the fourth decimal place. \n \n Article 4\n 1. On the dates indicated Iceland shall reduce customs duties on imports from the Community as originally constituted and from Ireland to the rates of the various basic duties applicable on 1 March 1970 specified below. >PIC FILE= \"T0010677\">  \n 2. After 1 January 1974 Iceland shall continue to reduce customs duties in respect of Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom in accordance with the timetable shown in paragraph 1. \n \n Article 5\n 1. The provisions concerning the progressive abolition of customs duties on imports shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. \n The Contracting Parties may replace a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty by an internal tax. \n 2. Iceland may temporarily retain, with due regard to the conditions of Article 19, customs duties of a fiscal nature on the products specified in Annex II. \n When production is started in Iceland of a product of like kind to one of those listed in Annex II, the duty to which the latter product is subject must be reduced to the level which would have been reached if that duty had been reduced in accordance with the timetable contained in Article 4 (1) since the entry into force of the Agreement. If in respect of third countries a customs duty lower than the duty of a fiscal nature is introduced, the tariff reductions shall be made on the basis of the former duty. \n Subsequent reductions shall be made in accordance with the timetable laid down in Article 4 (1). \n 3. Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom may retain until 1 January 1976 a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty upon implementation of Article 38 of the \"Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and  the Adjustments to the Treaties\" drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \n \n Article 6\n 1. No new charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Iceland. \n 2. Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports introduced on or after 1 January 1972 in trade between the Community and Iceland shall be abolished upon the entry into force of the Agreement. \n Any charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports, the rate of which on 31 December 1972 is higher than that actually applied on 1 January 1972, shall be reduced to the latter rate upon the entry into force of the Agreement. \n 3. Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the following timetable:    (a) by 1 January 1974 at the latest each charge shall be reduced to 60 % of the rate applied on 1 January 1972; \n      (b) three further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on: \n 1 January 1975, \n 1 January 1976, \n 1 July 1977. \n \n \n \n Article 7\n 1. No customs duty on exports or charge having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Iceland. \n Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be abolished not later than 1 January 1974. \n 2. Iceland may retain the system of export levy on fish products applicable on 1 January 1972, which is set out in Annex III. \n Any changes must not alter the character or aims of the system. The Joint Committee shall be notified beforehand of any changes. \n \n Article 8\n Protocol No 1 lays down the tariff treatment and arrangements applicable to certain products. \n \n Article 9\n Protocol No 2 lays down the tariff treatment and arrangements applicable to certain goods obtained by processing agricultural products. \n \n Article 10\n 1. In the event of specific rules being established as a result of the implementation of its agricultural policy or of any alteration of the current rules the Contracting Party in question may adapt the arrangements resulting from this Agreement in respect of the products which are the subject of those rules or alterations. \n 2. In such cases the Contracting Party in question shall take due account of the interests of the other Contracting Party. To this end the Contracting Parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 30. \n \n Article 11\n Protocol No 3 lays down the rules of origin. \n \n Article 12\n A Contracting Party which is considering the reduction of the effective level of its duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to third countries benefiting from most-favoured-nation treatment, or which is considering the suspension of their application, shall, as far as may be practicable, notify the Joint Committee not less than thirty days before such reduction or suspension comes into effect. It shall take note of any representations by the other Contracting Party regarding any distortions which might result therefrom. \n \n Article 13\n 1. No new quantitative restriction on imports or measures having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Iceland. \n 2. The Community shall abolish quantitative restrictions on imports on 1 January 1973 and any measures having an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions on imports not later than 1 January 1975.  \n Iceland shall abolish quantitative restrictions on imports and any measures having an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions on imports not later than 1 January 1975. \n \n Article 14\n 1. The Community reserves the right to modify the arrangements applicable to the petroleum products falling within headings Nos 27.10, 27.11, 27.12, ex 27.13 (paraffin wax, micro-crystalline wax, or bituminous shale and other mineral waxes) and 27.14 of the Brussels Nomenclature upon adoption of a common definition of origin for petroleum products, upon adoption of decisions under the common commercial policy for the products in question or upon establishment of a common energy policy. \n In this event the Community shall take due account of the interests of Iceland ; to this end it shall inform the Joint Committee, which shall meet under the conditions set out in Article 32. \n 2. Iceland reserves the right to take similar action should it be faced with like situations. \n 3. Subject to paragraphs 1 and 2, the Agreement shall not prejudice the non-tariff rules applied to imports of petroleum products. \n \n Article 15\n 1. The Contracting Parties declare their readiness to foster, so far as their agricultural policies allow, the harmonious development of trade in agricultural products to which the Agreement does not apply. \n 2. The Contracting Parties shall apply their rules in veterinary, health and plant health matters in a non-discriminatory fashion and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly obstructing trade. \n 3. The Contracting Parties shall examine, under the conditions set out in Article 33, any difficulties that might arise in their trade in agricultural products and shall endeavour to seek appropriate solutions. \n \n Article 16\n From 1 July 1977 products originating in Iceland may not enjoy more favourable treatment when imported into the Community than that applied by the Member States of the Community between themselves. \n \n Article 17\n Protocol No 6 lays down the special provisions applicable to imports of certain fish products into the Community. \n \n Article 18\n The Agreement shall not preclude the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade, except in so far as they alter the trade arrangements provided for in this Agreement, in particular the provisions concerning rules of origin. \n \n Article 19\n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination between the products of one Contracting Party and like products originating in the territory of the other Contracting Party. \n Products exported to the territory of one of the Contracting Parties may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. \n \n Article 20\n Payments relating to trade in goods and the transfer of such payments to the Member State of the Community in which the creditor is resident or to Iceland shall be free from any restrictions. \n \n Article 21\n The Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, law and order or public security, the protection of life and health of humans, animals or plants, the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value, the protection of industrial and commercial property, or rules relating to gold or silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions must not,  however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties. \n \n Article 22\n Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures:    (a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; \n      (b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defence purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes; \n      (c) which it considers essential to its own security in time of war or serious international tension. \n \n \n \n Article 23\n 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure likely to jeopardize the fulfilment of the objectives of the Agreement. \n 2. They shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. \n If either Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 28. \n \n Article 24\n 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Iceland:    (i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition as regards the production of or trade in goods; \n      (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Contracting Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; \n      (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. \n \n \n 2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 28. \n \n Article 25\n Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is due to:    (i) the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party, as provided for in the Agreement, of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question ; and \n      (ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party; \n \n \n the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 28. \n \n Article 26\n If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 28. \n \n Article 27\n If serious disturbances arise in any sector of the economy or if difficulties arise which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation  of a region, the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 28. \n \n Article 28\n 1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 25 and 27 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Contracting Party. \n 2. In the cases specified in Articles 23 to 27, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3 (d) applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties. \n In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. \n The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. \n 3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:    (a) As regards Article 24, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement within the meaning of Article 24 (1). \n The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to. \n If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in question ; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions. \n      (b) As regards Article 25, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties. \n If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported. \n The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein. \n      (c) As regards Article 26, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures. \n      (d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 25, 26 and 27 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. \n \n \n \n Article 29\n Where one or more Member States of the Community or Iceland is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith. \n \n Article 30\n 1. A Joint Committee is hereby established which shall be responsible for the administration of the Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose, it shall make recommendations and take decisions in the cases provided for in the Agreement. These decisions shall be put into effect by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own rules. \n 2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement the Contracting Parties shall exchange information and, at the request of either Party, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee.  \n 3. The Joint Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure. \n \n Article 31\n 1. The Joint Committee shall consist of representatives of the Community, on the one hand, and of representatives of Iceland, on the other. \n 2. The Joint Committee shall act by mutual agreement. \n \n Article 32\n 1. Each Contracting Party shall preside in turn over the Joint Committee, in accordance with the arrangements to be laid down in its rules of procedure. \n 2. The Chairman shall convene meetings of the Joint Committee at least once a year in order to review the general functioning of the Agreement. \n The Joint Committee shall, in addition, meet whenever special circumstances so require, at the request of either Contracting Party, in accordance with the conditions to be laid down in its rules of procedure. \n 3. The Joint Committee may decide to set up any working party that can assist it in carrying out its duties. \n \n Article 33\n 1. Where a Contracting Party considers that it would be useful in the common interest of both Contracting Parties to develop the relations established by the Agreement by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned request to the other Contracting Party. \n The Contracting Parties may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening negotiations. \n 2. The agreements resulting from the negotiations referred to in paragraph 1 will be subject to ratification or approval by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own procedures. \n \n Article 34\n The Annexes and Protocols to the Agreement shall form an integral part thereof. \n \n Article 35\n Either Contracting Party may denounce the Agreement by notifying the other Contracting Party. The Agreement shall cease to be in force twelve months after the date of such notification. \n \n Article 36\n The Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories to which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community applies upon the terms laid down in that Treaty and, on the other, to the territory of the Republic of Iceland. \n \n Article 37\n This Agreement is drawn up in duplicate in the Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Icelandic, Italian and Norwegian languages, each of these texts being equally authentic. \n This Agreement will be approved by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own procedures. \n It shall enter into force on 1 January 1973, provided that the Contracting Parties have notified each other before that date that the procedures necessary to this end have been completed. \n After this date this Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following such notification. The final date for such notification shall be 30 November 1973. \n The provisions applicable on 1 April 1973 shall be applied upon the entry into force of this Agreement if it enters into force after that date. \n \n \n   Udf\u00e6rdiget i Bruxelles, den toogtyvende juli nitten hundrede og tooghalvfjerds. \n Geschehen zu Br\u00fcssel am zweiundzwanzigsten Juli neunzehnhundertzweiundsiebzig. \n Done at Brussels on this twenty-second day of July in the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two. \n Fait \u00e0 Bruxelles, le vingt-deux juillet mil neuf cent soixante-douze. \n Fatto a Bruxelles, il ventidue luglio millenovecen settantadue. \n Gedaan te Brussel, de twee\u00ebntwintigste juli negentienhonderdtwee\u00ebnzeventig. \n Utferdiget i Brussel, tjueandre juli nitten hundre og syttito. \n Gj\u00f6rt \u00ed Bruxelles, tuttugasta og annan dag j\u00fal\u00edm\u00e1na\u00d0ar n\u00edtj\u00e1nhundru\u00d0 sj\u00f6t\u00edu og tv\u00f6.  \n P\u00e5 R\u00e5det for De europ\u00e6iske F\u00e6llesskabers vegne \n Im Namen des Rates der Europ\u00e4ischen Gemeinschaften \n In the name of the Council of the European Communities \n Au nom du Conseil des Communaut\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes \n A nome del Consiglio delle Comunit\u00e0 Europee \n Namens de Raad van de Europese Gemeenschappen \n For R\u00e5det for De Europeiske Fellesskap >PIC FILE= \"T0010678\">  \n \n \nANNEX I List of products referred to in Article 2 of the Agreement\n >PIC FILE= \"T0010679\">   \n ANNEX II Customs duties of a fiscal nature drawn up on 1 April 1972\n  >PIC FILE= \"T0010680\">   >PIC FILE= \"T0010681\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010682\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010683\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010684\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010685\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010686\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010687\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010688\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010689\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010690\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010691\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010692\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010693\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010694\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010695\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010696\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010697\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010698\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010699\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010700\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010701\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010702\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010703\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010704\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010705\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010706\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010707\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010708\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010709\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010710\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010711\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010712\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010713\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010714\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010715\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010716\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010717\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010718\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010719\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010720\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010721\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010722\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010723\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010724\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010725\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010726\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010727\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010728\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010729\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010730\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010731\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010732\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010733\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010734\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010735\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010736\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010737\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010738\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010739\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010740\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010741\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010742\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010743\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010744\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010745\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010746\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010747\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010748\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010749\">   \n >PIC FILE= \"T0010750\">   \n \n ANNEX III System of export levy on fish products which Iceland may retain\n Icelandic Law No 4 of 28 February 1966 as amended by Laws Nos 79 of 31 December 1968, 73 of 1 June 1970, 4 of 30 March 1971 and 17 of 4 May 1972, concerning export levy on fish products\n Article 1\n A levy shall be applied to exports of Icelandic fish products specified in this Law. \n Fish caught by fishing vessels registered in Iceland shall be considered as Icelandic products even if such fish is caught outside Icelandic fishing limits and not processed ashore. \n \n Article 2\n In accordance with this Law, the export levy on fish products shall be applied as follows:    1. A levy of 2 300 Icelandic Crowns per ton shall be applied to exports of frozen fish fillets, frozen fish roes, salted whitefish, salted fish fillets, belly of salted cod, salted fish roes not elsewhere specified, salted fish bits, salted and frozen fish tongues, stockfish, dried fish heads, shellfish and preserved fish products in hermetic containers. \n Should the levy applied under this Article exceed 4 75 % of the f.o.b. value of the fish products in question, the Ministry of Fisheries may decide to abolish the part of the levy which is in excess thereof. \n      2. A levy of 3 % of the f.o.b. value shall be applied to exports of whole frozen fish, frozen fish waste, frozen Norway lobster, frozen shrimp, frozen capelin, capelin meal, capelin oil and hydrogenated oils and fats from fish or marine mammals. \n      3. A levy of 5 % of the f.o.b. value shall be applied to exports of whale products other than preserved in hermetic containers. \n      4. A levy of 6 % of the f.o.b. value shall be applied to exports of fish meal, redfish meal, Norway lobster meal, shrimp meal, liver meal, codliver oil, redfish oil, whole frozen herring, frozen herring fillets, salted herring, salted herring fillets, salted lumpfish roes and other fish products not specified in this Article. \n 500 Icelandic Crowns per 100 kg of contents may be deducted from the f.o.b. value of salted herring and salted lumpfish roes to cover packing costs. \n      5. A levy of 7 % of the f.o.b. value shall be applied to exports of fresh and chilled fish. \n The Ministry of Fisheries may, however, decide that they levy on fresh or chilled herring shall be equal to that which would have been applicable had the herring been processed in Iceland by the same method as it to be used abroad (see points 4 and 6 of this Article). \n      6. A levy of 8 % of the f.o.b. value shall be applied to exports of herring meal, herring solubles and herring oil. \n      7. Seal products are not subject to the export levy. \n For the purposes of point 1, uncooked preserved products in hermetic containers shall mean uncooked preserved products ready for consumption in hermetic containers of 10 kg net or less. Fully processed uncooked products in larger containers shall also be regarded as uncooked preserved products in hermetic containers if the exporter supplies proof that the value of the unprocessed product is less than one-third of the export value of the exported products. \n Where Icelandic vessels sell, in foreign ports, fresh or processed fish products caught by their own or other vessels and subject to this levy, the said levy shall be applied on the gross value of such sales, less customs duties and other unloading and sales charges, in accordance with rules issued by the Ministry of Fisheries.  \n \n \n \n Article 3\n The Treasury shall collect the export levy in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, and the receipts shall be distributed as follows: >PIC FILE= \"T0010751\">  \n Payment of the insurance premiums for fishing vessels referred to in item 1 may be subject to the condition that the insurance company concerned be a member of the Underwriters'' Reinsurance Union and be required to apply certain rules concerning calculation of premium rates, insurance terms and hull values. \n Whalers may be exempted from these conditions and are then entitled to reimbursement of their contribution to the Fishing Vessels'' Insurance Fund instead of the insurance premiums. \n \n Article 4\n The levy provided for in Article 2, points 2, 3 and 4, shall be applied to the selling price of the products, including packing, f.o.b. vessel in the first port of landing. The value of products sold c.i.f. or under other terms shall be adjusted to the f.o.b. value in accordance with rules issued by the Ministry of Trade. \n Where unsold products are exported the export levy provided for in Article 2, points 2, 3 and 4, shall be calculated on the basis of the minimum export price stipulated in the export licence. \n If the exporter supplies proof, within 6 months of the date shown on the bill of lading, that the price of an unsold fish product, as determined by the competent authority, is higher than the actual selling price, the Ministry of Finance shall refund the difference, subject to confirmation by the Ministry of Trade that sale at the lower price has been approved. \n The levy provided for in Article 2, point 1, shall be applied to the net weight of the sold product, which must be indicated in the export documents. \n \n Article 5\n The export levy falls due as soon as a ship has been cleared for sailing or before landing, should customs clearance not be required. The Ministry of Fisheries may, however, authorize the shipper to pay the dues when he receives the foreign currency, provided that the transaction is carried out through an Icelandic bank and that he gives the Customs Authorities a promissory note, representing the exchange value of the sum due. \n \n Article 6\n Shippers of products covered by the provisions of this Law shall submit to the competent authority before a ship is cleared for sailing or before landing a duplicate or a certified copy of the bill of lading or other shipping documents, an export declaration, an invoice and, if required, a certificate of inspection, together with an export licence.

No new customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Portugal.  \n 2. Customs duties on imports shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the following timetable:    (a) on 1 April 1973 each duty shall be reduced to 80 % of the basic duty; \n      (b) four further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on: \n 1 January 1974, \n 1 January 1975, \n 1 January 1976, \n 1 July 1977. \n \n \n \n Article 4\n 1.

Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom may retain until 1 January 1976 a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty in the event of implementation of Article 38 of the \"Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties\" drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \n 3. Portugal shall abolish the protective element contained in customs duties of a fiscal nature:    (a) either in one stage on 1 July 1975, for the customs duties of a fiscal nature in Annex II, list A, and for the rates which are given there in respect of each heading; \n      (b) or for the products appearing in Annex II, list B, and for the rates which are given there in respect of each heading, in the proportions and in accordance with the timetables shown in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 for list A of this Protocol. \n \n \n 4.

The basic duty to which the successive reductions provided for in Article 3 and in Protocol No 1 are to be applied shall, for each product, be the duty actually applied on 1 January 1972. \n As regards Portugal, however, in respect of products listed in Annex III, on which duties have been suspended on 1 January 1972 for short-term economic reasons, the basic rates shall be those of the Portuguese Customs Tariff as shown in that Annex in respect of each heading. Within the limit of the rates indicated, the basic duty to be taken into consideration by Portugal in calculating the reductions provided for in the Agreement shall be that actually applied at any given moment vis-\u00e0-vis third countries. \n 2. If, after 1 January 1972, any tariff reductions resulting from the tariff agreements concluded as a result of the Trade Conference held in Geneva from 1964 to 1967 become applicable, such reduced duties shall replace the basic duties referred to in paragraph 1. \n 3.

No new charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Portugal. \n 2. Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports introduced on or after 1 January 1972 in trade between the Community and Portugal shall be abolished upon the entry into force of the Agreement.  \n Any charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports, the rate of which on 31 December 1972 is higher than that actually applied on 1 January 1972, shall be reduced to the latter rate upon the entry into force of the Agreement. \n 3. Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the following timetable:    (a) by 1 January 1974 at the latest each charge shall be reduced to 60 % of the rate applied on 1 January 1972; \n      (b) three further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on: \n 1 January 1975, \n 1 January 1976, \n 1 July 1977. \n \n \n \n Article 7\n No customs duty on exports or charge having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Portugal. \n Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be abolished not later than 1 January 1974. \n \n Article 8\n Protocol No 1 lays down the tariff treatment and arrangements applicable to certain products. \n \n Article 9\n Protocol No 2 lays down the tariff treatment and arrangements applicable to certain goods obtained by processing agricultural products. \n \n Article 10\n 1.

In such cases the Contracting Party in question shall take due account of the interests of the other Contracting Party. To this end the Contracting Parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 29. \n \n Article 11\n Protocol No 3 lays down the rules of origin. \n \n Article 12\n Protocol No 5 lays down the treatment applicable to certain charges for special purposes in force in Portugal. \n \n Article 13\n A Contracting Party which is considering the reduction of the effective level of its duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to third countries benefiting from most-favoured-nation treatment, or which is considering the suspension of their application, shall, as far as may be practicable, notify the Joint Committee not less than thirty days before such reduction or suspension comes into effect. It shall take note of any representations by the other Contracting Party regarding any distortions which might result therefrom. \n \n Article 14\n 1. No new quantitative restriction on imports or measures having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Portugal. \n 2. Quantitative restrictions on imports shall be abolished on 1 January 1973 and any measures having an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions on imports shall be abolished not later than 1 January 1975. \n \n Article 15\n 1. Protocol No 6 lays down the special treatment applicable to imports of motor vehicles and to the motor vehicle assembly industry in Portugal. \n 2. Protocol No 7 lays down the treatment applicable to imports into Portugal of certain iron and steel and petroleum products. \n \n Article 16\n 1. The Community reserves the right to modify the arrangements applicable to the petroleum products falling within headings Nos 27.10, 27.11, 27.12, ex 27.13 (paraffin wax, micro-crystalline wax, or bituminous shale and other mineral waxes) and 27.14 of the Brussels Nomenclature upon adoption of a  common definition of origin for petroleum products, upon adoption of decisions under the common commercial policy for the products in question or upon establishment of a common energy policy. \n In this event the Community shall take due account of the interests of Portugal ; to this end it shall inform the Joint Committee, which shall meet under the conditions set out in Article 34. \n 2. Portugal reserves the right to take similar action should it be faced with like situations. \n 3. Subject to paragraphs 1 and 2 and Protocol No 7, the Agreement shall not prejudice the non-tariff rules applied to imports of petroleum products. \n \n Article 17\n 1. The Contracting Parties declare their readiness to foster, so far as their agricultural policies allow, the harmonious development of trade in agricultural products to which the Agreement does not apply. \n 2. The Contracting Parties shall apply their rules in veterinary, health and plant health matters in a non-discriminatory fashion and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly obstructing trade. \n 3. The Contracting Parties shall examine, under the conditions set out in Article 34, any difficulties that might arise in their trade in agricultural products and shall endeavour to seek appropriate solutions. \n \n Article 18\n Protocol No 8 lays down the treatment applicable to certain agricultural products. \n \n Article 19\n From 1 July 1977 products originating in Portugal may not enjoy more favourable treatment when imported into the Community than that applied by the Member States of the Community between themselves. \n \n Article 20\n The Agreement shall not preclude the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade, except in so far as they alter the trade arrangements provided for in the Agreement, in particular the provisions concerning the rules of origin. \n \n Article 21\n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination between the products of one Contracting Party and like products originating in the territory of the other Contracting Party. \n Products exported to the territory of one of the Contracting Parties may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. \n \n Article 22\n Payments relating to trade in goods and the transfer of such payments to the Member State of the Community in which the creditor is resident or to Portugal shall be free from any restrictions. \n \n Article 23\n The Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, law and order or public security, the protection of life and health of humans, animals or plants, the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value, the protection of industrial and commercial property, or rules relating to gold or silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions must not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties. \n \n Article 24\n Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures:    (a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; \n      (b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defence purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the  conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes; \n      (c) which it considers essential to its own security in time of war or serious international tension. \n \n \n \n Article 25\n 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure likely to jeopardize the fulfilment of the objectives of the Agreement. \n 2. They shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. \n If either Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 30. \n \n Article 26\n 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Portugal:    (i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition as regards the production of or trade in goods; \n      (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Contracting Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; \n      (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. \n \n \n 2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 30. \n \n Article 27\n Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is due to:    (i) the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party, as provided for in the Agreement, of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question ; and \n      (ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party; \n \n \n the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 30. \n \n Article 28\n If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 30. \n \n Article 29\n If serious disturbances arise in any sector of the economy or if difficulties arise which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 30. \n \n Article 30\n 1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 27 and 29 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Contracting Party. \n 2. In the cases specified in Articles 25 to 29, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3 (d) applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in question shall supply the  Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties. \n In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. \n The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. \n 3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:    (a) As regards Article 26, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement within the meaning of Article 26 (1). \n The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to. \n If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in question ; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions. \n      (b) As regards Article 27, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties. \n If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported. \n The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein. \n      (c) As regards Article 28, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures. \n      (d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 27, 28 and 29 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. \n \n \n \n Article 31\n Where one or more Member States of the Community or Portugal is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith. \n \n Article 32\n 1.

Subject to the availability of capacity in United States Commission facilities for uranium enrichment and within such quantities as may be authorized for transfer, contracts with Euratom, or with authorized persons within the Community, may be entered into by the United States Commission as herein set forth for the production or enrichment of uranium enriched in the isotope U-235 for use as fuel in power applications undertaken within the Community. It is understood by the Parties that, at such times as Euratom, or such authorized persons, have requirements for such services and are prepared to execute firm contracts under the United States Commission''s standard terms which set forth the agreed delivery schedules and other conditions for supply of such services, Euratom, or such authorized persons, will have access on an equitable basis with other purchasers of such services to uranium enrichment capacity then available to the United States Commission and not already allocated, or to other means of supply in accordance with existing United States Commission policy. Contracts for supply of such services will be negotiated and executed on a timely basis. \n B. Additionally, upon request by Euratom or authorized persons within the Community, the United States Commission may, at its option and under such terms and conditions as may be agreed, sell uranium enriched in the isotope U-235 in such amounts as are within quantities authorized for transfer for use as fuel in power applications undertaken within the Community. \n C. Under such terms and conditions as may be agreed and within such quantities as may be authorized for transfer, the United States Commission  may transfer (including inter alia supply through enrichment services contracts) to Euratom or authorized persons within the Community uranium enriched in the isotope U-235 for use in research applications, including inter alia fuel for research, materials testing, and experimental reactors and reactor experiments. The principle of equitable treatment among its foreign customers will govern the United States Commission in its decisions on the situations under which such uranium will be supplied and on the type of transfer to be employed. \n D. Special nuclear material may also be transferred (including inter alia supply through enrichment services contracts) to either Party, or to persons authorized by it to receive such material, under such terms and conditions as may be agreed and within such quantities as may be authorized for transfer, for the performance within the territory of the receiving Party of conversion or fabrication services, or both, and for subsequent return to the territory of the Party from which it was transferred, or for subsequent transfer to any other nation or group of nations pursuant, in case of the performance of the conversion or fabrication services within the Community, to Article XI of the Joint Program Agreement. \n E. Irradiated special nuclear material of United States origin may be transferred to Euratom, or to authorized persons within the Community, under such terms and conditions as the Parties may agree and within such quantities as may be authorized for transfer, for chemical reprocessing and subsequent retention within the Community for applications within the scope of this Agreement, or subsequent transfer to a nation outside the Community or another group of nations pursuant to Article XI of the Joint Program Agreement. \n F. Special nuclear material other than uranium enriched in the isotope U-235 may be transferred to Euratom, or to authorized persons within the Community, for use as fuel in reactors and reactor experiments and for other peaceful applications, provided that the net amount of material so transferred by the United States Commission shall not exceed such quantities as may be authorized for transfer, and that the terms and conditions of each such transfer shall be agreed upon in advance. \n\"\n Article II\n Article I bis of the Additional Agreement is amended to read as follows: \n \"A. The enriched uranium supplied under this Agreement may contain up to twenty percent (20 %) in the isotope U-235. A portion of the uranium enriched in the isotope U-235 so supplied may be made available as material containing more than twenty percent (20 %) in the isotope U-235 when the use of such material is technically or economically justified. \n B. Subject to the provisions of Article II bis, the quantity of uranium enriched in the isotope U-235 transferred under Article I or Article II to the Community or to authorized persons within the Community for purposes authorized in this Agreement may include such amounts as are mutually agreed are necessary for the accomplishment of such purposes, including the fueling of reactors or reactor experiments within the Community and their efficient and continuous operation. \n C.  Special nuclear material produced as a result of irradiation processes in any part of the fuel that may be leased by the United States Commission under this Agreement shall be for the account of the lessee and, after reprocessing, title to such produced material shall be in the lessee unless the United States Commission and the lessee otherwise agree. \n D.  Special nuclear material produced through the use of material transferred to the Community or to authorized persons within the Community pursuant to this Agreement may be transferred to any nation outside the Community or any other group of nations, provided that such nation or group of nations has an appropriate agreement for cooperation with the Government of the United States of America or guarantees the use of such material for peaceful purposes under safeguards acceptable to the Parties. \n E.   1 Special nuclear material of non-United States origin which is exported from the Community to the United States of America shall not, if re-exported from the United States of America to the Community, be charged against the quantity authorized for transfer to the Community and, if not improved while in the United States of America, shall be exempt from the safeguards required pursuant to this Agreement. \n   2  The material shall be deemed to be improved and therefore subject to the safeguards required pursuant to this Agreement when    (a) the concentration of fissionable isotopes in it has been increased, \n      (b) the amount of chemically separable fissionable isotopes in it has been increased, or \n      (c) its chemical or physical form has been changed so as to facilitate further use or processing.  \n \n \n F.  Some atomic energy materials which may be provided in accordance with this Agreement are harmful to persons and property unless handled and used carefully. After delivery of such materials, the Community shall bear all responsibility, insofar as the Government of the United States of America is concerned, for the safe handling and use of such materials. With respect to any special nuclear material which the United States Commission may, pursuant to this Agreement, lease to the Community, or to authorized persons within the Community, the Community shall indemnify and save harmless the Government of the United States of America against any and all liability (including third party liability) for any cause whatsoever arising out of the production, fabrication, ownership, lease, possession and use of such special nuclear material after delivery by the United States Commission. \n \n\" \n \n Article III\n Article II of the Additional Agreement, as amended, is amended to read as follows: \n \"A. With respect to the application of atomic energy to peaceful uses, it is understood that arrangements may be made between either Party or authorized persons under its jurisdiction and authorized persons under the jurisdiction of the other Party for the transfer of special nuclear material and for the performance of services with respect thereto for the uses specified in Article I and subject to the relevant provisions of Article I bis and to the provisions of Article II bis. \n B. The Parties agree that the activities referred to in paragraph A of this Article shall be subject to the limitations in Article III and, on a non-discriminatory basis, to the export policies of the Community and the Government of the United States of America with regard to transactions involving the authorized persons referred to in paragraph A of this Article. \n \n\" \n \n Article IV\n A new Article II bis is added to read as follows: \n \"Article II bis    A. The total quantity of U-235 in enriched uranium transferred by the Government of the United States of America or persons authorized by it under Articles I and II of this Agreement shall not exceed the quantity authorized for transfer by the United States Commission pursuant to United States law. \n      B. The net amounts of special nuclear material other than U-235 in enriched uranium which may be transferred by the United States Commission under Article I, paragraph F of this Agreement shall not exceed the quantities authorized for transfer by United States law. The net amounts of such material shall be the gross quantity of each such special nuclear material transferred less the quantity thereof which has been returned to the United States of America or transferred to any other nation or group of nations pursuant to Article XI of the Joint Program Agreement. \n \n\" \n \n Article V\n The definition of \"person\" in paragraph (a) of Article XV of the Joint Program Agreement, incorporated by reference in Article V of the Additional Agreement, is changed to read as follows: \n \"\"Person\" means any individual, enterprise, corporation, partnership, firm, association, trust, estate, public or private institution, group, government agency, government corporation, or national, regional or local government, but does not include the Parties to this Agreement.\"\n \n Article VI\n Paragraph B of Article VI of the Additional Agreement, as amended, is amended to read as follows: \n \"B. The Parties agree that their undertakings under this Agreement are subject to appropriate statutory steps, including authorization by competent bodies of the Community and the Government of the United States of America, and the provisions of applicable laws, treaties, regulations and license requirements in effect in the Community, in the United States and within the Member States. \n \n\" \n \n Article VII\n This Amendment shall enter into force on the date on which each Party shall have received from the other Party written notification that it has complied with all statutory and constitutional requirements for the entry into force of such Amendment and shall remain in force for the period of the Additional Agreement, as amended.  \n \n   In witness whereof, the undersigned, duly authorized, have signed this Amendment. \n Done at Washington, in duplicate, this twentieth day of September, 1972. \n FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: \n Walter J.

The new Member States shall apply in respect of the Lebanese Republic the customs duties reductions provided for in Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 of Annex I in the proportions and following the timetables shown therein. However, the duties thus reduced may in no case be lower than those applied by the new Member States in respect of the Community as originally constituted. \n 2. The customs duties, on the basis of which the new Member States apply to the Lebanese Republic, and the reductions provided for in paragraph 1 shall be those which they apply at any given time in respect of third countries. \n 3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, should the application of these provisions temporarily result in tariff movements away from alignment on the final duty, the new Member States may maintain their duties until the level of these duties has been reached on the occasion of a subsequent alignment, or they may apply the duty resulting from a subsequent alignment as soon as this alignment reaches or passes the said level. \n 4. Subject to the effect to be given by the Community to Article 39 (5) of the Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties, annexed to the Treaty of Accession, paragraph 1 shall be applied, as regards the specific duties or the specific part of mixed duties of the customs tariffs of Ireland and the United Kingdom, by rounding to the fourth place of decimals. In other cases Article 10 (2) of Annex I shall apply. \n \n Article 4\n Where, for the products listed in Annex I to the Agreement, the new Member States apply duties comprising protective and fiscal elements, only the protective elements of those duties, within the meaning of Article 38 of the Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties, shall be aligned on the preferential duties set out in that Annex and reduced as provided in Article 3 (1) and (2). \n \n Article 5\n The tariff quota provided for in Article 3 of Annex I to the Agreement, as amended by Article 2 of this Protocol, shall be allocated as follows: \n Other woven fabrics of cotton: >PIC FILE= \"T0019748\">  \n \n Article 6\n 1. The minimum price provided for in Article 5 (2) of Annex I to the Agreement shall be calculated in the new Member States by reference to the incidence of the duties which they apply at any given time to third countries. \n 2. The levies and fixed components referred to in Articles 8 and 9 of Annex I shall be calculated in the new Member States by reference to the rates they apply at any given time to third countries. \n \n Article 7\n 1. The rules which the new Member States apply in respect of the Lebanese Republic, under Article 4 of Annex I to the Agreement may under no circumstances be more favourable than those which they apply in respect of the Community as originally constituted. \n 2. Imports into the United Kingdom of the products listed in Annex I to this Protocol and originating in the Lebanon may be limited to the following annual quotas:    - 1973 quota : 100 metric tons \n      - 1974 quota : 125 metric tons. \n \n \n \n Article 8\n The Lebanese Republic shall, in respect of the new Member States, reduce the difference between the customs duties and charges having equivalent effect which it applies in respect of third countries and those which it applies, under Article 1 of Annex II to the Agreement, in respect of the Community, in accordance with the following schedule: >PIC FILE= \"T0019749\">  \n \n Article 9\n 1.

Until the end of the fourth year of the Agreement, paragraph 1 shall not be applicable in respect of countries granted preferential treatment by the Republic of Cyprus at the time of entry into force of the Agreement. \n However, the tariff measures taken by the Republic of Cyprus shall not have the effect of increasing any preference enjoyed by these countries. \n \n Article 3\n 1. The customs duties and taxes having equivalent effect applicable on the importation into Cyprus of products originating in the Community mentioned in List A shall be those of the General Customs Tariff of Cyprus, reduced by the percentages and according to the time table set out in Article 1, provided that such reductions do not exceed the number of points shown under each heading in relation to the General Tariff of Cyprus. \n 2.

This condition shall not apply, however, to products which, within the meaning of this Protocol, originate in Cyprus; \n \n \n      2. products originating in Cyprus, provided that they have been transported to the importing Member State directly, within the meaning of Article 5:    (a) products wholly obtained in Cyprus; \n      (b) products obtained in Cyprus, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) above are used, provided that the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 3. This condition shall not apply, however, to products which, within the meaning of this Protocol, originate in the Community. \n \n The products listed in List C shall be temporarily excluded from the scope of this Protocol. \n \n Article 2\n The following shall be considered as wholly obtained either in the Member States or in Cyprus, within the meaning of Article 1, 1 (a) and 2 (a):    (a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their sea or ocean bed; \n      (b) vegetable products harvested there; \n      (c) live animals born and raised there; \n      (d) products from live animals; \n      (e) products from hunting and fishing conducted there; \n      (f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea by their vessels; \n      (g) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in (f); \n      (h) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials; \n      (i) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there; \n      (j) goods produced there exclusively from products specified in (a) to (i). \n \n \n \n Article 3\n For the purpose of implementing Article 1, 1 (b) and 2 (b), the following shall be considered as sufficient working or processing:    (a) working or processing as a result of which the goods obtained receive a classification under a tariff heading other than that covering each of the products worked or processed, except, however, working or processing appearing in List A, where the special provisions of that list apply; \n      (b) working or processing appearing in List B. \n \n \n \"Tariff headings\" shall mean the headings in the Brussels Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs. \n \n Article 4\n Where the Lists A and B referred to in Article 3 provide that the goods obtained in a Member State or in Cyprus shall be considered as originating there  only if the value of the products worked or processed does not exceed a given percentage of the value of the goods obtained, the value to be taken into consideration for determining such percentage shall be:  - on the one hand: \n as regards products whose importation can be proved : their customs value at the time of importation; \n as regards products of undetermined origin : the earliest ascertainable price paid for such products in the territory of the State where manufacture takes place; \n - on the other hand: \n the ex-factory price of the goods obtained, less internal taxes refunded or refundable on exportation. \n \n \n \n Article 5\n The following shall be considered as transported directly from the exporting Member State to Cyprus or from Cyprus to the importing Member State:    (a) goods transported without passing through territory other than that of Contracting Parties; \n      (b) goods transported through territories other than those of Contracting Parties, or transhipped in such territories, if the passage in such territories or the transhipment is covered by a single transport document drawn up in a Member State or in the Republic of Cyprus. \n \n \n Transhipments carried out in the ports of territories other than those of Contracting Parties shall not be considered as interrupting direct transport if such transhipments are caused by force majeure or are the result of events at sea. \n \n TITLE II Methods of administrative cooperation \n Article 6\n \"Originating\" products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, in the importing Member State or in Cyprus, benefit from the provisions of the Agreement, upon submission of an A.CY.1 movement certificate issued by the customs authorities of the Republic of Cyprus or the customs authorities of the exporting Member State. \n However, products sent by post (including parcels) shall, provided that the consignments contain only \"originating\" products and that the value does not exceed one thousand units of account per consignment, benefit from the provisions of the Agreement in the Member State or in Cyprus, on the presentation of form A.CY.2, subject to each parcel bearing the label contained in Part 2 of this form. \n \n Article 7\n Movement certificate A.CY.1 shall be issued only on application being made in writing by the exporter, on the form prescribed for this purpose. \n \n Article 8\n The A.CY.1 movement certificate shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting State when the goods to which it relates are exported.

The back of this portion may be adhesive. \n The Member States and the Republic of Cyprus may reserve the right to print the forms themselves or may have them printed by approved printers. In the latter case, each form must carry a reference to such approval. Each form must bear the name and address of the printer or a sign by which the printer can be identified. Each part shall also bear a serial number by which it can be identified. \n \n Article 13\n For each postal consignment, an A.CY.2 form shall be completed. After completing and signing the two parts of the form, the exporter shall insert his declaration (Part 1) in the consignment and stick the label from Part 2 on the outer packing of the consignment. \n These provisions do not dispense exporters from complying with any formalities required by customs or postal regulations. \n \n Article 14\n Unless they suspect some irregularity, the customs authorities of the Member State or of the Republic of Cyprus shall admit as benefiting from the provisions of the Agreement any goods contained in a consignment bearing an A.CY.2 label. \n For the purpose of a random check or in a case of doubt as to regularity, the customs authorities of a Member State or of the Republic of Cyprus may ask for a verification by the customs authorities of the Republic of Cyprus or the Member State, forwarding, for this purpose, Part 1 of the A.CY.2 form contained in the consignment, and may suspend, while waiting for the result of such examination, the application of the Agreement. In such cases, the goods may be released to the importer, subject to such safeguards as may be considered necessary.  \n \n Article 15\n 1. Member States and the Republic of Cyprus shall admit as \"originating\" products benefiting from the provisions of the Agreement, without requiring the production of an A.CY.1 movement certificate or the completion of an A.CY.2 form, goods sent as small packages to private persons or forming part of passengers'' personal luggage, in so far as such goods are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the conditions required for the application of this Agreement, and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such declaration. \n 2. Importations which are occasional and consist solely of goods for the personal use of the addressee or passenger or his family, it being evident from the nature and quality of the goods that no commercial purpose is in view, shall not be considered as importations by way of trade. Furthermore, the total value of these goods must not exceed 60 units of account in the case of small packages or 200 units of account in the case of the contents of passengers'' personal luggage. \n \n Article 16\n 1.

In the latter case, each form must carry a reference to such approval. Each form must bear the name and address of the printer or a sign by which the printer can be identified. Each part shall also bear a serial number by which it can be identified. \n \n Article 13\n For each postal consignment, an A.CY.2 form shall be completed. After completing and signing the two parts of the form, the exporter shall insert his declaration (Part 1) in the consignment and stick the label from Part 2 on the outer packing of the consignment. \n These provisions do not dispense exporters from complying with any formalities required by customs or postal regulations. \n \n Article 14\n Unless they suspect some irregularity, the customs authorities of the Member State or of the Republic of Cyprus shall admit as benefiting from the provisions of the Agreement any goods contained in a consignment bearing an A.CY.2 label. \n For the purpose of a random check or in a case of doubt as to regularity, the customs authorities of a Member State or of the Republic of Cyprus may ask for a verification by the customs authorities of the Republic of Cyprus or the Member State, forwarding, for this purpose, Part 1 of the A.CY.2 form contained in the consignment, and may suspend, while waiting for the result of such examination, the application of the Agreement. In such cases, the goods may be released to the importer, subject to such safeguards as may be considered necessary.  \n \n Article 15\n 1. Member States and the Republic of Cyprus shall admit as \"originating\" products benefiting from the provisions of the Agreement, without requiring the production of an A.CY.1 movement certificate or the completion of an A.CY.2 form, goods sent as small packages to private persons or forming part of passengers'' personal luggage, in so far as such goods are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the conditions required for the application of this Agreement, and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such declaration. \n 2.

It shall, in particular, be authorized to take any measures necessary to adapt them to the particular requirements of specific goods or certain forms of transport.\n\n\n\n\nANNEX I\n\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTES\n\n\n\n\nNote 1 \u2014 Article 1\n\n\n\n\nThe terms \u2018the Community\u2019 or \u2018Norway\u2019 shall also cover the territorial waters of the Member States of the Community or of Norway respectively.\n\n\nVessels operating on the high seas, including factory ships, on which the fish caught is worked or processed shall be considered as part of the territory of the State to which they belong provided that they satisfy the conditions set out in Explanatory Note 5.\n\n\n\n\nNote 2 \u2014 Articles 1, 2 and 3\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine whether goods originate in the Community or in Norway or in one of the countries specified in Article 2, it shall not be necessary to establish whether the power and fuel, plant and equipment, and machines and tools used to obtain such goods originate in third countries or not.\n\n\n\n\nNote 3 \u2014 Articles 2 and 5\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of implementing Article 2 paragraph 1 (A) (b) and (B) (b), the percentage rule must be observed by referring, for the added value acquired, to the provisions contained in Lists A and B. Where the products obtained appear in List A, the percentage rule therefore constitutes a criterion additional to that of change of tariff heading for any non-originating product used. Likewise the provisions ruling out the possibility of cumulating the percentages shown in Lists A and B for any one product obtained are applicable in each country for the added value acquired.\n\n\n\n\nNote 4 \u2014 Articles 1, 2 and 3\n\n\n\n\nPacking shall be considered as forming a whole with the goods contained therein. This provision, however, shall not apply to packing which is not of the normal type for the article packed and which has intrinsic utilization value and is of a durable nature, apart from its function as packing.\n\n\n\n\nNote 5 \u2014 Article 4 (f)\n\n\n\n\nThe term \u2018their vessels\u2019 shall apply only to vessels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich are registered or recorded in a Member State of the Community or in Norway;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich sail under the flag of a Member State of the Community or of Norway;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich are at least 50 % owned by nationals of Member States of the Community or of Norway or by a company with its head office in one of those States, of which the manager or managers, chairman of the board of directors or of the supervisory board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of the Member States of the Community or of Norway, and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to those States or to public bodies or nationals of the said States;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof which the captain and officers are all nationals of the Member States of the Community or of Norway; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of the Member States of the Community or of Norway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 6 \u2014 Article 6\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Ex-works price\u2019 shall mean the price paid to the manufacturer in whose undertaking the last working or processing is carried out, provided the price includes the value of all the products used in manufacture.\n\n\n\u2018Customs value\u2019 shall be understood as meaning the customs value laid down in the Convention concerning the Valuation of Goods for Customs Purposes signed in Brussels on 15 December 1950.\n\n\n\n\nNote 7 \u2014 Article 8\n\n\n\n\nThe customs authorities which endorse movement certificates in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 8 (3) have the right to undertake verification of the goods in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in the State concerned.\n\n\n\n\nNote 8 \u2014 Article 10\n\n\n\n\nWhere a movement certificate relates to goods originally imported from a Member State of the Community or from Norway, and re-exported in the same state, the new certificates issued by the re-exporting State must, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 24, show in which State the original movement certificate was issued. Where the goods have not been placed in a bonded warehouse, the certificates must also show that the endorsements provided for in Article 8 (3) have duly been made.\n\n\n\n\nNote 9 \u2014 Articles 16 and 22\n\n\n\n\nWhere a movement certificate has been issued under the conditions laid down in Article 8 (2) or (4) and relates to goods re-exported in the same state, the customs authorities of the country of destination must be able to obtain, by means of administrative cooperation, true copies of the movement certificate or certificates issued previously relating to those goods.\n\n\n\n\nNote

or remission, partial or complete, of customs duties applicable to products used in manufacture, provided that the said provision concedes, expressly or in effect, this repayment or non-charging or the non-imposition when goods obtained from the said products are exported but not when they are retained for home use.\n\n\n\n\nNote 12 \u2014 Articles 24 and 25\n\n\n\n\nArticle 24 (1) and Article 25 (1) shall mean, in particular, that application has not been made:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\n\n\n\n\neither of the provisions of the last sentence of Article 1 (2) (b) for products of

No new customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Norway. \n 2. Customs duties on imports shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the following timetable:     (a) on the date of entry into force of the Agreement each duty shall be reduced to 80 % of the basic duty; \n      (b) four further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on: \n 1 January 1974; \n 1 January 1975; \n 1 January 1976; \n 1 July 1977. \n \n \n \n Article 3\n 1. The provisions concerning the progressive abolition of customs duties on imports shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. \n The Contracting Parties may replace a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty by an internal tax. \n 2. Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom may retain until 1 January 1976 a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty in the event of implementation of Article 38 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the Treaties. \n \n Article 4\n 1. The basic duty to which the successive reductions provided for in Article 2 and the Protocol are to be applied shall, for each product, be the duty actually applied on 1 January 1972. \n 2. The reduced duties calculated in accordance with Article 2 and the Protocol shall be applied rounded to the first decimal place. \n Subject to the application by the Community of Article 39 (5) of the Act concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the Treaties, as regards the specific duties or the specific part of the mixed duties in the Irish Customs Tariff, Article 2 and the Protocol shall be applied, with rounding to the fourth decimal place. \n \n Article 5\n 1. No new charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Norway. \n 2. Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports introduced on or after 1 January 1972 in trade between the Community and Norway shall be abolished upon the entry into force of the Agreement. \n Any charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports, the rate of which on 31 December 1972 is higher than that actually applied on 1 January 1972, shall be reduced to the latter rate upon the entry into force of the Agreement. \n 3. Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the following timetable:    (a) by 1 January 1974 at the latest each charge shall be reduced to 60 % of the rate applied on 1 January 1972; \n      (b) three further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on: \n 1 January 1975; \n 1 January 1976; \n 1 July 1977. \n \n \n \n Article 6\n No customs duty on exports or charge having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Norway. \n Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be abolished not later than 1 January 1974. \n \n Article 7\n The Protocol lays down the tariff treatment and arrangements applicable to certain products. \n \n Article 8\n The provisions determining the rules of origin for the application of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway signed this same day shall also be applicable to this Agreement. \n \n Article 9\n A Contracting Party which is considering the reduction of the effective level of its duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to third countries benefiting from most-favoured-nation treatment, or which is considering the suspension of their application, shall, as far as may be practicable, notify the Joint Committee not less than 30 days before such reduction or suspension comes into effect. It shall take note of any representations by the other Contracting Party regarding any distortions which might result therefrom.  \n \n Article 10\n 1. No new quantitative restriction on imports or measure having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Norway. \n 2. Quantitative restrictions on imports shall be abolished on the date of entry into force of the Agreement and any measures having an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions on imports shall be abolished not later than 1 January 1975. \n \n Article 11\n From 1 July 1977 products originating in Norway may not enjoy more favourable treatment when imported into the Community than that applied by the Member States of the Community between themselves. \n \n Article 12\n The Agreement shall not modify the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community or the powers and jurisdiction deriving therefrom. \n \n Article 13\n The Agreement shall not preclude the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade, except in so far as they alter the trade arrangements provided for in the Agreement, in particular the provisions concerning rules of origin. \n \n Article 14\n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination between the products of one Contracting Party and like products originating in the territory of the other Contracting Party. \n Products exported to the territory of one of the Contracting Parties may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. \n \n Article 15\n Payments relating to trade in goods and the transfer of such payments to the Member State of the Community in which the creditor is resident or to Norway shall be free from any restrictions. \n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any exchange or administrative restriction on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short- and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident participates. \n \n Article 16\n The Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, law and order or public security, the protection of life and health of humans, animals or plants, the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value, or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions must not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties. \n \n Article 17\n Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures:    (a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; \n      (b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defense purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes; \n      (c) which it considers essential to its own security in time of war or serious international tension. \n \n \n \n Article 18\n 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure likely to jeopardize the fulfilment of the objectives of the Agreement. \n 2. They shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. \n If either Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24.  \n \n Article 19\n 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Norway:    (i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition as regards the production of or trade in goods; \n      (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Contracting Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; \n      (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. \n \n \n 2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24. \n \n Article 20\n 1. The Community shall extend, for products of Chapter 73 of the Brussels Nomenclature covered by the Agreement, the application of Article 60 of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and of the implementing decisions thereto to sales of undertakings falling within its jurisdiction to the territory of Norway, while ensuring to this end adequate transparency of freight rates for deliveries to the territory of Norway. \n 2. In the matter of prices, Norway shall ensure for deliveries of products of Chapter 73 of the Brussels Nomenclature covered by this Agreement, by undertakings subject to its jurisdiction, both in the territory of Norway and to the common market:    - observance of the prohibition on unfair competition; \n      - observance of the principle of non-discrimination; \n      - disclosure of prices ex the chosen basing point and of conditions of sale; \n      - observance of the rules on alignment; \n \n \n while ensuring to this end adequate transparency of freight rates. \n Norway shall take the measures required continually to achieve the same effects as those produced by the implementing decisions taken by the Community in this matter. \n As regards deliveries to the Common Market, Norway shall also ensure observance of decisions by the Community prohibiting alignment on quotations from certain third countries, having regard to the transitional provisions concerning the accession of Denmark to the Community. \n As regards deliveries to the Irish market, Norway shall furthermore ensure observance of the transitional provisions applying to the accession of Ireland to the Community and limiting the possibilities of alignment on this market. \n The Community has provided Norway with a list of decisions implementing Article 60 and ad hoc decisions concerning the prohibition on alignment and with the text of the transitional provisions concerning the Danish and Irish markets. It will also inform Norway immediately if any change in the decisions referred to above is adopted. \n 3.    (a) As regards point (c) in paragraph 2, Norway may, for deliveries made in the territory of Norway, authorize the iron and steel undertakings falling within its jurisdiction to charge delivery prices by destination without reference to the chosen basing point. In this case, Norway shall ensure disclosure by those undertakings of the selling prices by destination and of the conditions of sale. \n      (b) In observance of the principle of non-discrimination set out in point (b) of paragraph 2, the delivery prices by destination must be compatible with and consistent with the prices ex the chosen basing point for deliveries in the territory of the European Coal and Steel Community. \n \n 4. If the offers made by Norwegian undertakings are detrimental or liable to be so to the proper functioning of the Community market or if the offers made by Community undertakings are detrimental or liable to be so to the proper functioning of the Norwegian market and if any such detriment is attributable to differential application of the rules established under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 or to breach of those rules by the undertakings in question, the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24.  \n \n Article 21\n Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is due to:    - the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party, as provided for in the Agreement, of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question ; and \n      - the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party; \n \n \n the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24. \n \n Article 22\n If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement on implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24. \n \n Article 23\n If serious disturbances arise in any sector of the economy or if difficulties arise which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24. \n \n Article 24\n 1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 21 and 23 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Contracting Party. \n 2. In the cases specified in Articles 18 to 23, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3 (e) applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties. \n In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. \n The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. \n 3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:    (a) As regards Article 19, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement within the meaning of Article 19 (1). \n The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to. \n If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practice in question ; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions. \n      (b) As regards Article 20, the Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to consider an appropriate sanction for the practice in question. \n In the absence of agreement within the Joint Committee or, according to the case, if no satisfactory sanction is imposed on the undertaking at fault, the Contracting Party concerned may take the measures it considers necessary to deal both with the difficulties resulting from differences in application or from infringement  and with the risk of distortion of competition. These measures may in particular take the form of withdrawal of tariff concessions and release of the undertakings concerned from the commitment to comply with price rules in their dealings on the other Contracting Party''s market. \n The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within that Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. \n In urgent cases, the Contracting Party concerned may make a direct request to the other Contracting Party:      - to put an immediate stop to the practice objected to, \n          - to take steps to impose a sanction on the undertaking at fault. \n \n \n If the Contracting Party concerned does not consider that the matter has been settled satisfactorily, it may initiate the procedure provided for within the Joint Committee. \n      (c) As regards Article 21, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties. \n If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported. \n The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein. \n      (d) As regards Article 22, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures. \n      (e) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 21, 22 and 23 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to deal with the situation. \n \n \n \n Article 25\n Where one or more Member States of the Community or Norway is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith. \n \n Article 26\n 1. A Joint Committee is hereby established, which shall be responsible for the administration of the Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose, it shall make recommendations and take decisions in the cases provided for in the Agreement. These decisions shall be put into effect by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own rules. \n 2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall exchange information and, at the request of either Party, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee. \n 3. The Joint Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure. \n \n Article 27\n 1. The Joint Committee shall consist of representatives of the Contracting Parties. \n 2. The Joint Committee shall act by mutual agreement. \n \n Article 28\n 1. Each Contracting Party shall preside in turn over the Joint Committee, in accordance with the arrangements to be laid down in its rules of procedure. \n 2.

The Joint Committee may decide to set up any working party that can assist it in carrying out its duties.  \n \n Article 29\n 1. Where a Contracting Party considers that it would be useful in the common interest of the Contracting Parties to develop the relations established by the Agreement by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned request to the other Contracting Party. \n The Contracting Parties may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening negotiations. \n These recommendations may, where appropriate, aim at the attainment of a concerted harmonization, provided that the autonomy of decision of the Contracting Parties is not impaired. \n 2. The agreements resulting from the negotiations referred to in paragraph 1 will be subject to ratification or approval by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own procedures. \n \n Article 30\n The Annex and the Protocol to the Agreement shall form an integral part thereof. \n \n Article 31\n Any Contracting Party may denounce the Agreement by notifying the other Contracting Party. The Agreement shall cease to be in force twelve months after the date of such notification. \n \n Article 32\n The Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories to which the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community applies upon the terms laid down in that Treaty and, on the other, to the territory of the Kingdom of Norway. \n \n Article 33\n This Agreement is drawn up in duplicate in the Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Norwegian languages, each of these texts being equally authentic. \n This Agreement will be approved by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own procedures. \n It shall enter into force on 1 July 1973, provided that the Contracting Parties have notified each other before that date that the procedures necessary to this end have been completed. \n After that date this Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following such notification.

This means that the importers are obliged to store the goods for more or less long periods.\n\n\nWhere it is intended to re-export the goods, it is in the importer''s interest to place them under a customs procedure which obviates the need to pay import duties and taxes.\n\n\nWhen goods are intended for outright importation, it is again in the importer''s interest to be able to delay payment of the import duties and taxes until the goods are actually taken into home use.\n\n\nIn order to make these facilities available to importers, most countries have provided in their national legislations for the customs warehousing procedure.\n\n\nHowever, imported goods are not the only goods which may qualify for customs warehousing.\n\n\nFor example, some countries allow goods that are liable to, or have borne, internal duties and taxes (whether of national origin or previously imported against payment of import duties and taxes) to be stored in customs warehouses in order that they may qualify for exemption from, or repayment of, such internal duties and taxes.\n\n\nSimilarly, the deposit in a customs warehouse of goods that have previously been dealt with under another customs procedure or that may qualify, upon exportation, for repayment of import duties and taxes, makes it possible for the customs authorities to grant discharge of such other customs procedure or to repay the import duties and taxes, as the case may be, before the goods are actually re-exported.\n\n\nThe provisions of this Annex do not apply to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe storage of goods in temporary store (locked premises and enclosed or unenclosed spaces approved by the customs, in which goods may be stored pending clearance);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe storage of goods in free ports and free zones;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe processing or manufacturing, under customs supervision, of goods conditionally relieved from import duties and taxes in premises approved by the customs (inward processing warehouses).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Annex:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe term \u2018customs warehousing procedure\u2019 means the customs procedure under which imported goods are stored under customs control in a designated place (a customs warehouse) without payment of import duties and taxes;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe term \u2018import duties and taxes\u2019 means customs duties and all other duties, taxes, fees or other charges which are collected on or in connection with the importation of goods, but not including fees and charges which are limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe term \u2018customs control\u2019 means measures applied to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations which the customs are responsible for enforcing;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe term \u2018security\u2019 means that which ensures, to the satisfaction of the customs, that an obligation to the customs will be fulfilled.

destination finale des marchandises import\u00e9es n''est pas connue au moment de l''importation dans un nombre \u00e9lev\u00e9 de cas, ce qui oblige les importateurs \u00e0 les stocker pendant des d\u00e9lais plus ou moins longs.\n\n\nS''il s''agit de marchandises destin\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9export\u00e9es, l''importateur a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 les placer sous un r\u00e9gime douanier qui permet d''\u00e9viter le paiement des droits et taxes \u00e0 l''importation.\n\n\nQuant aux marchandises qui sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 l''importation d\u00e9finitive, il est \u00e9galement de l''int\u00e9r\u00eat de l''importateur de pouvoir retarder le paiement des droits et taxes \u00e0 l''importation jusqu''au moment o\u00f9 ces marchandises seront effectivement mises \u00e0 la consommation.\n\n\nPour accorder ces facilit\u00e9s aux importateurs, les \u00c9tats ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pr\u00e9vu le r\u00e9gime de l''entrep\u00f4t de douane dans leur l\u00e9gislation nationale.\n\n\nLes marchandises import\u00e9es ne sont cependant pas les seules qui soient admissibles en entrep\u00f4t de douane.\n\n\nC''est ainsi que certains \u00c9tats permettent que les marchandises d''origine nationale ou nationalis\u00e9es, qui sont passibles de droits ou de taxes internes, ou qui les ont support\u00e9s, soient mises en entrep\u00f4t de douane afin d''obtenir l''exon\u00e9ration ou le remboursement de ces droits et taxes.\n\n\nDe m\u00eame, la mise en entrep\u00f4t de douane de marchandises auxquelles a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 un autre r\u00e9gime douanier ou qui sont susceptibles de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier, lors de leur exportation, d''un remboursement des droits et taxes \u00e0 l''importation, permet aux autorit\u00e9s douani\u00e8res d''accorder, selon le cas, l''apurement de cet autre r\u00e9gime douanier ou le remboursement des droits et taxes \u00e0 l''importation, sans attendre la

the unit of account defined in paragraph 1 shall be the relation between the weight of fine gold contained in the unit of account and the weight of fine gold corresponding to the par value of that currency communicated to the International Monetary Fund. If no par value has been communicated, or if exchange rates differing from the par value by a margin exceeding that authorized by the International Monetary Fund are applied to current payments, the weight of fine gold corresponding to the parity of the currency shall be calculated on the basis of the exchange rate for a currency directly or indirectly expressed in and convertible into gold which is applied in the Member State to current payments, on the day of the calculation, and on the basis of the par value communicated to the International Monetary Fund for that convertible currency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unit of account defined in paragraph 1 shall remain unchanged throughout the period in which the Financial Protocol is in force.

These provisions shall, however, apply to those goods only if the exporting State charges a countervailing levy, the rate of which is a percentage of the duties laid down in the Common Customs Tariff for third country products used in their manufacture. This percentage, fixed by the Council of Association for each of such periods as it may determine, shall be based on the tariff reduction granted on those goods in the importing State. The Council of Association shall also lay down the rules for the countervailing levy, taking into account the relevant rules in force before 1 July 1968 in trade between Member States.\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The countervailing levy shall not, however, be charged on exports from the Community or from Turkey of goods obtained or produced under the conditions mentioned in this Article while the reduction of customs duties on the majority of goods imported into the territory of the other Contracting Party does not exceed 20 %, taking into account the various timetables for tariff reductions fixed by this Protocol.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nThe Council of Association shall determine the methods of administrative cooperation to be used in implementing Articles 2 and 3, taking into account the methods laid down by the Community with regard to trade between Member States.\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If either Contracting Party considers that differences arising from the application to imports of customs duties, quantitative restrictions or any measures having equivalent effect, or from any other measure of commercial policy, threaten to deflect trade or to cause economic difficulties in its territory, it may bring the matter before the Council of Association, which shall, if necessary, recommend appropriate methods for avoiding any harm liable to result therefrom.\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where deflections occur or economic difficulties arise and the Party concerned considers that they call for immediate action, that Party may itself take the necessary protective measures, and shall notify the Council of Association thereof without delay; the Council of Association may decide whether the Party concerned shall amend or abolish those measures.\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the choice of such measures preference shall be given to those which least disturb the operation of the Association and, in particular, the normal development of trade.\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\nDuring the transitional stage the Contracting Parties shall, in so far as may be- necessary for the proper functioning of the Association, take steps to approximate their law, regulation or administrative action in respect of customs matters, taking into account the approximations already effected by the Member States of the Community.\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n\n\nTHE CUSTOMS UNION\n\n\n\n\nSection I\n\n\n\n\nElimination of customs duties between the Community and Turkey\n\n\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Contracting Parties shall refrain from introducing between themselves any new customs duties on imports or exports or charges having equivalent effect, and from increasing those already applied, in their trade with each other at the date of entry into force of this Protocol.\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Council of Association may, however, authorize the Contracting Parties to introduce new customs duties on exports or charges having equivalent effect if they are necessary for the attainment of the objectives of the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 8\n\n\nCustoms duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect, in force between the Community and Turkey, shall be progressively abolished in accordance with Articles 9 to 11.\n\n\nArticle 9\n\n\nOn the entry into force of this Protocol, the Community shall abolish customs duties and charges having equivalent effect on imports from Turkey.\n\n\nArticle 10\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each product, the basic duty on which Turkey is to apply the successive reductions shall be the duty actually applied in respect of the Community at the date of signature of this Protocol.\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The timetable for the reductions to be effected by Turkey shall be as follows: the first reduction shall be made on the entry into force of this Protocol.

The fourth and subsequent reductions shall be made each year in such a way that the final reduction is made at the end of the transitional stage.\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each reduction shall be made by lowering the basic duty on each product by 10 %.\n\n\nArticle 11\n\n\nNotwithstanding Article 10 (2) and (3), Turkey shall progressively abolish, over a period of twenty-two years, in accordance with the following timetable, the basic duties in respect of the Community on the products listed in Annex 3: a reduction of 5 % on each duty shall be made on the entry into force of this Protocol.

The Council of Association shall make recommendations to this end.\n\n\nArticle 14\n\n\nWhere, in respect of a country outside the Association, Turkey applies a shorter timetable than is provided for in Articles 10 and 11 to the elimination of a charge having effect equivalent to a customs duty, the same timetable shall be applied to the elimination of that charge in respect of the Community.\n\n\nArticle 15\n\n\nWithout prejudice to Article 7 (2), the Contracting Parties shall, at the latest four years after the entry into force of this Protocol, abolish between themselves, customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect.\n\n\nArticle 16\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 7 (1) and Articles 8 to 15 shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature.\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the entry into force of this Protocol the Community and Turkey shall inform the Council of Association of their customs duties of a fiscal nature.\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turkey shall retain the right to substitute for these customs duties of a fiscal nature an internal tax which complies with the provisions of Article 44.\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Council of Association finds that substitution for any customs duty of a fiscal nature meets with serious difficulties in Turkey, it shall authorize that country to retain the duty on condition that it shall abolish it not later than the end of the transitional stage.

No new charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Switzerland. \n 2. Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports introduced on or after 1 January 1972 in trade between the Community and Switzerland shall be abolished upon the entry into force of the Agreement. \n Any charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports, the rate of which on 31 December 1972 is higher than that actually applied on 1 January 1972, shall be reduced to the latter rate upon the entry into force of the Agreement. \n 3.

It shall take note of any representations by the other Contracting Party regarding any distortions which might result therefrom. \n \n Article 9\n 1. No new quantitative restriction on imports or measure having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Switzerland. \n 2. Quantitative restrictions on imports shall be abolished on 1 January 1973 and any measures having an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions on imports shall be abolished not later than 1 January 1975.  \n \n Article 10\n From 1 July 1977 products originating in Switzerland may not enjoy more favourable treatment when imported into the Community than that applied by the Member States of the Community between themselves. \n \n Article 11\n The Agreement shall not modify the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community or the powers and jurisdiction deriving therefrom. \n \n Article 12\n The Agreement shall not preclude the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade, except in so far as they alter the trade arrangements provided for in the Agreement, in particular the provisions concerning rules of origin. \n \n Article 13\n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination between the products of one Contracting Party and like products originating in the territory of the other Contracting Party. \n Products exported to the territory of one of the Contracting Parties may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. \n \n Article 14\n Payments relating to trade in goods and the transfer of such payments to the Member State of the Community in which the creditor is resident or to Switzerland shall be free from any restrictions. \n The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any exchange or administrative restriction on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short- and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident participates. \n \n Article 15\n The Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, law and order or public security, the protection of life and health of humans, animals or plants, the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value, or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions must not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties. \n \n Article 16\n Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures:    (a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; \n      (b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defence purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes; \n      (c) which it considers essential to its own security in time of war or serious international tension. \n \n \n \n Article 17\n 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure likely to jeopardize the fulfilment of the objectives of the Agreement. \n 2. They shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. \n If either Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 23. \n \n Article 18\n 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Switzerland:    (i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction  or distortion of competition as regards the production of or trade in goods; \n      (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Contracting Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; \n      (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. \n \n \n 2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, it may take the appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 23. \n \n Article 19\n If the offers made by Swiss undertakings are likely to be detrimental to the functioning of the Common Market and if any such detriment is attributable to a difference in the conditions of competition as regards prices, Member States may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 23. \n \n Article 20\n Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is due to:    (i) the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party, as provided for in the Agreement, of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question; \n and \n      (ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party; \n \n \n the Contracting Party concerned may take the appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 23. \n \n Article 21\n If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 23. \n \n Article 22\n If serious disturbances arise in any sector of the economy or if difficulties arise which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 23. \n \n Article 23\n 1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 20 and 22 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Contracting Party. \n 2. In the cases specified in Articles 17 to 22, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3(e) applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties. \n In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. \n The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. \n 3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:    (a) As regards Article 18, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement within the meaning of Article 18 (1). \n The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to.  \n If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in question ; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions. \n      (b) As regards Article 19, the Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where necessary, to consider appropriate measures. \n If Switzerland fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee, the Member States may adopt the safeguard measures they consider necessary to avoid, or put an end to, any detriment to the functioning of the common market ; in particular they may withdraw tariff concessions. \n      (c) As regards Article 20, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties. \n If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported. \n The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein. \n      (d) As regards Article 21, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures. \n      (e) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 20, 21 and 22 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to deal with the situation. \n \n \n \n Article 24\n Where one or more Member States of the Community or Switzerland is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith. \n \n Article 25\n 1. A Joint Committee is hereby established, which shall be responsible for the administration of the Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose, it shall make recommendations and take decisions in the cases provided for in the Agreement. These decisions shall be put into effect by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own rules. \n 2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall exchange information and, at the request of either Party, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee. \n 3. The Joint Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure. \n \n Article 26\n 1. The Joint Committee shall consist of representatives of the Contracting Parties. \n 2.

The Joint Committee may decide to set up any working party that can assist it in carrying out its duties.  \n \n Article 28\n The Annex to the Agreement shall form an integral part thereof. \n \n Article 29\n Either Contracting Party may denounce the Agreement by notifying the other Contracting Party. The Agreement shall cease to be in force twelve months after the date of such notification. \n \n Article 30\n The Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories to which the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community applies upon the terms laid down in that Treaty and, on the other, to the territory of the Swiss Confederation. \n \n Article 31\n This Agreement is drawn up in duplicate in the Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Norwegian languages, each of these texts being equally authentic. \n This Agreement will be approved by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own procedures. \n It shall enter into force on 1 January 1973, provided that the Contracting Parties have notified each other before that date that the procedures necessary to this end have been completed. \n In the event of application of Article 2 (3) of the Decision of the Council of the European Communities of 22 January 1972 concerning the accession of the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the European Coal and Steel Community, this Agreement may take effect only for the States that have deposited the instruments specified in that paragraph. \n After 1 January 1973, this Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the notification referred to in paragraph 3. The final date for such notification shall be 30 November 1973. \n The provisions applicable on 1 April 1973 shall be applied upon the entry into force of this Agreement if it enters into force after
